## 入不二法門品第九

Entering The Dharma Door of Non-Duality

### 爾時維摩詰謂眾菩薩言：「諸仁者！云何菩薩入不二法門？各隨所樂說之。」

Then Vimalakirti said to the gathering of bodhisattvas, “Venerables! How does a bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality? Let each of you explain as you wish.”  

### 會中有菩薩名法自在，說言：「諸仁者！生滅為二。法本不生，今則無滅，得此無生法忍，是為入不二法門。」

Within the assembly there was a bodhisattva called Sovereignty of the Dharma (Dharmavikurvaṇa) who said, “Venerables! “Arising [or birth] (*utpāda*) and ceasing [or extinction] (*nirodha*) make a duality. Dharma fundamentally do not arise [are not born], therefore there is no cessation. Attaining this *anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti* (“Patient Tolerance of the Birthlessness [or Nonarising] of Phenomena”]  is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”   

### 德守菩薩曰：「我、我所為二。因有我故，便有我所；若無有我，則無我所，是為入不二法門。」

Merit Guardian Bodhisattva (Śrīgandha) said, “’I’ and ‘Mine’ make a duality. Since there is an ‘I’, then there is a ‘Mine’. Yet, if there is no ‘I’, then there is no ‘Mine' - this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

### 不眴菩薩曰：「受、不受為二。若法不受，則不可得；以不可得，故無取無捨、無作無行，是為入不二法門。」

Unblinking Bodhisattva (*Animiṣa*) said, “Sensing (*vedana*) and not sensing make a duality. If *dharma* are not sensed (received or made contact with) then they cannot be attained (’felt’). And by there being nothing attainable, there is no grasping and no relinquishing, no doing and no habituation (*saṃskāra*), and this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 德頂菩薩曰：「垢、淨為二。見垢實性，則無淨相，順於滅相，是為入不二法門。」

Crown of Merit (Śrīkūṭa) Bodhisattva said, “Defiled (*saṃkleśa*) and pure (*vyavadāna*) make a duality. Seeing the true nature of defilement, then there is no[thing to have the] characteristic of purity. Being in accord with the cessation of characteristics, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

### 善宿菩薩曰：「是動、是念為二。不動則無念，無念則無分別。通達此者，是為入不二法門。」

Fortunate Constellation (Bhadrajyotis) Bodhisattva said, “To be moved (*vikṣepa* or stirred) and to be mindful (*manyanā*, i.e. ‘still’) make a duality. If there is no movement then there is no mind[ing], and without mind[ing] there is no discrimination. To penetrate this is to enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 善眼菩薩曰：「一相、無相為二。若知一相即是無相，亦不取無相，入於平等，是為入不二法門。」

Excellent Eye (Sunetra) Bodhisattva said, “The single characteristic  (*ekalakṣaṇa*) and characteristiclessness (*alakṣaṇa*) make a duality. If one knows the single characteristic is characteristicless, and does not cling to characteristiclessness, entering equanimity (*samata*), this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality. 

### 妙臂菩薩曰：「菩薩心、聲聞心為二。觀心相空，如幻化者，無菩薩心、無聲聞心，是為入不二法門。」

“Wonderful Arm (Subāhu) Bodhisattva said, “The mind of a bodhisattva and the mind of a voice hearer make a duality. Observing that the characteristics of mind are empty, like illusory transformations, without a mind of a bodhisattva, without a mind of a voice hearer, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

### 弗沙菩薩曰：「善、不善為二。若不起善、不善，入無相際而通達者，是為入不二法門。」

Puṣya Bodhisattva said, “Good (or ’excellent’) and not good make a duality. If one does not give rise to the good and what is not good, entering into and penetrating the limit of characteristiclessness, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

### 師子菩薩曰：「罪、福為二。若達罪性，則與福無異，以金剛慧決了此相，無縛無解者，是為入不二法門。」

Lion Bodhisattva (Siṃha) said, “Blame (*sāvadya*) and blessing (*anavadya*) make a duality. If one penetrates the nature of blame, it is no different than that of blessing. Being unbound and liberated by Vajra Wisdom that definitively understands this characteristic is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 師子意菩薩曰：「有漏、無漏為二。若得諸法等，則不起漏、不漏想，不著於相，亦不住無相，是為入不二法門。」

Lion Mind Bodhisattva (Siṃhamati) said, “Having outflows (*sāsrava*) and being without outflows (*anāsrava*) make a duality. If one attains the equality (*samatā*) of all *dharma*, one does not give rise to the perception (*saṃjñā*) of outflows or being without outflows. Being unattached to characteristics yet not abiding in characteristiclessness is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 淨解菩薩曰：「有為、無為為二。若離一切數，則心如虛空，以清淨慧無所礙者，是為入不二法門。」

Pure Liberation Bodhisattva (Śuddhāmukti) said, “The conditioned and the unconditioned make a duality. If one transcends categorization, the mind is like space, and pure wisdom without obstruction is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”    

### 那羅延菩薩曰：「世間、出世間為二。世間性空，即是出世間。於其中不入、不出、不溢、不散，是為入不二法門。」

Nārāyaṇa Bodhisattva said, “Worldly (*laukika*) and transcendent (*lokotara*) make a duality. The nature of the world is empty, so too is transcendence. To neither enter nor exit, nor go beyond, nor settle within them is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 善意菩薩曰：「生死、涅槃為二。若見生死性，則無生死，無縛無解，不生不滅，如是解者，是為入不二法門。」

Virtuous Mind Bodhisattva (Dāntamati) said, “Samsara (’birth and death’) and Nirvana make a duality. One who sees that the nature (*svabhāva*) of birth and death is without birth or death, without bondage or liberation, neither arisen nor ceased. Being liberated like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”       

### 現見菩薩曰：「盡、不盡為二。法若究竟，盡若不盡，皆是無盡相；無盡相即是空，空則無有盡不盡相。如是入者，是為入不二法門。」

Manifesting Sight Bodhisattva (Pratyakṣadarśana) said, “Exhaustible (*kṣaya*) and inexhaustible (*akṣaya*) make a duality.  Whether *dharmas* are ultimately exhaustible or inexhaustible, they are all without the characteristic of exhaustibility. Being without the characteristic of exhaustibility is Emptiness and Emptiness is without the characteristics of exhaustibility or inexhaustibility. Entering like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

### 普守菩薩曰：「我、無我為二。我尚不可得，非我何可得？見我實性者，不復起二，是為入不二法門。」

Universal Guardian Bodhisattva (Pariguḍha) said, “Self (*ātman*) and No-Self (*anātman*) make a duality. A self cannot even be attained (found), how could a ‘not self’ be attained? Seeing the Real Nature of the self, not giving further rise to duality, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”    

### 電天菩薩曰：「明、無明為二。無明實性即是明，明亦不可取，離一切數，於其中平等無二者，是為入不二法門。」

Thunder Deva Bodhisattva (Vidyuddeva) said, “Illuminated (*vidyā,* wisdom) and unilluminated ( *avidyā,* Ignorance) make a duality. The Real Nature of the unilluminated is illuminated, for illumination can also not be grasped and transcends all measurement. Being within their equality, without duality, is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”     

### 喜見菩薩曰：「色、色空為二。色即是空，非色滅空，色性自空。如是受、想、行、識、識空為二，識即是空，非識滅空，識性自空，於其中而通達者，是為入不二法門。」

Joyful Sight Bodhisattva (Priyadarśana) said, “Form and the emptiness of form make a duality. Form is just empty. Not by the emptiness of the cessation (or destruction) of form, form is empty by its very nature. Like this, sensation, perception, conditioning, consciousness, and the emptiness of consciousness make dualities. Consciousness is just empty. Not by the emptiness of the cessation of consciousness, consciousness is empty by its very nature. Penetrating the middle of these is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”         

### 明相菩薩曰：「四種異、空種異為二。四種性即是空種性，如前際、後際空，故中際亦空。若能如是知諸種性者，是為入不二法門。」

Sign of Illumination Bodhisattva (Prābhaketu) said “Differentiating the Four Elements and differentiating them from the element Space make dualities. The nature of the Four Elements is the nature of the element Space; empty, like the future and past, the in between (i.e. present) is also empty. To know the nature of all elements like this is to enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”   

### 妙意菩薩曰：「眼、色為二。若知眼性，於色不貪、不恚、不癡，是名寂滅。如是耳聲、鼻香、舌味、身觸、意法為二，若知意性，於法不貪、不恚、不癡，是名寂滅，安住其中，是為入不二法門。」

Wonderful Mind Bodhisattva (Pramati) said, “The Eye and form make dualities. If one knows the nature of the eye, not being desirous, averse, or confused about form, this is called tranquil cessation. Like this, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and flavors, the body and feelings, the mind and ideas (*dharmas*), make dualities. Knowing the nature of the mind, not desirous of, averse to, or confused about ideas is called tranquil cessation, which peacefully abiding within is called entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”     

### 無盡意菩薩曰：「布施、迴向一切智為二。布施性即是迴向一切智性，如是持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定、智慧、迴向一切智為二，智慧性即是迴向一切智性，於其中入一相者，是為入不二法門。」

Inexhaustible Mind Bodhisattva (Akṣayamati) said, “*Dāna* (giving) and the transference to omniscience (*sarvajñānapariṇāmanā*) make a duality. The nature of *dāna* is the transference to omniscience. Like this, *śīla*, *kṣānti*, *virya*, *dhyāna, prajñā*, and the transference to omniscience make dualities. The nature of *prajñā* is the nature of the transference to omniscience, and to enter the singleness of these is to enter the Dharma Door on Nonduality.” ** ****  

### 深慧菩薩曰：「是空、是無相、是無作為二。空即無相，無相即無作；若空、無相、無作，則無心意識。於一解脫門即是三解脫門者，是為入不二法門。」

Profound Wisdom Bodhisattva (Gambhinīrmati) said, “Emptiness (*śūnyatā*), characteristiclessness (*ānamitta*), and desirelessness (*apraṇihita*) make dualities. Emptiness is without characteristics and that which is without characteristics is undesirable. If empty, characteristicless, and desireless, then there is no mind (*citta*), thought (*mānas*) or consciousness (*vijñāna*). That the three doors of liberation are a single door of liberation is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”    

### 寂根菩薩曰：「佛、法、眾為二。佛即是法，法即是眾，是三寶皆無為相，與虛空等，一切法亦爾。能隨此行者，是為入不二法門。」

Tranquil Roots Bodhisattva (Śāntendriya) said, “Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha make dualities. The Buddha is the Dharma, and the Dharma is the Sangha. These three jewels are without the characteristic of being conditioned, as equal as space, as are all *dharmas*. Being able to follow this practice is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”   

### 心無礙菩薩曰：「身、身滅為二。身即是身滅。所以者何？見身實相者，不起見身及見滅身，身與滅身無二無分別，於其中不驚、不懼者，是為入不二法門。」

Mind Unobstructed Bodhisattva (Apratihatanetra) said, “The body and the body’s extinction make a duality. The body is the body’s extinction. How so? One who sees the Real Nature of the body, not giving rise to seeing a body or seeing the extinction of the body. The body and the extinction of the body not as two, without differentiation. Being unalarmed in between them, being unafraid is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”    

### 上善菩薩曰：「身、口、意善為二。是三業皆無作相，身無作相，即口無作相；口無作相，即意無作相；是三業無作相，即一切法無作相。能如是隨無作慧者，是為入不二法門。」

Superior Virtue Bodhisattva (Suvinīta) said, “Virtues of body, speech, and mind make dualities. These three karmic actions are without the characteristic of being enacted (*anabhisaṃskāra-lakṣana*). The body is without the characteristic of being enacted, so the mouth is without the characteristic of being enacted. As the mouth is without the characteristic of being enacted, so the mind is without the characteristic of being enacted. These three karmic actions being without the characteristic of being enacted, then *dharmas* are without the characteristic of being enacted. Being able to follow unenacted wisdom like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”  

### 福田菩薩曰：「福行、罪行、不動行為二。三行實性即是空，空則無福行、無罪行、無不動行。於此三行而不起者，是為入不二法門。」

Field of Merit Bodhisattva (Puṇyakṣetra) said, “Meritorious acts, transgressive acts, and unmoving acts make dualities. The Real Nature of these three acts is emptiness, and emptiness is without meritorious action, without transgressive action, and without unmoving actions. Being in the non-arising of these three actions is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”   

### 華嚴菩薩曰：「從我起二為二。見我實相者，不起二法；若不住二法，則無有識。無所識者，是為入不二法門。」

Flower Arrangement Bodhisattva (Padmavyūha) said, “The arising of two (duality) from self makes a duality. One who sees the Real Characteristic of the self does not give rise to there being two things (*dharmas*). If there is no abiding in two things, then there is no consciousness [of anything]. Being without there being consciousness is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”   

### 德藏菩薩曰：「有所得相為二。若無所得，則無取捨。無取捨者，是為入不二法門。」

Treasury of Virtue Bodhisattva (Śrīgarbha) said, “The characteristic that there is something to attain something makes a duality. If there is nothing to attain, then there is nothing to grasp or let go of. Being without grasping and letting go is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality,” 

### 月上菩薩曰：「闇與明為二。無闇、無明，則無有二。所以者何？如入滅受想定，無闇、無明，一切法相亦復如是，於其中平等入者，是為入不二法門。」

Moon in Midair Bodhisattva (Candrottara) said, “Darkness along with illumination make a duality. Being without darkness and without illumination, then there are not two. How so? Like entering a meditation where there is the cessation of sensation and perception (*nirodhasamāpatti*), which is without darkness and without illumination, the characteristics of all *dharmas* are also like this. Entering the equality (*samatā*) of these is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”        

### 寶印手菩薩曰：「樂涅槃、不樂世間為二。若不樂涅槃、不厭世間，則無有二。所以者何？若有縛，則有解。若本無縛，其誰求解？無縛無解，則無樂厭，是為入不二法門。」

Jewel Mudra Hand Bodhisattva (Ratnamudrāhasta) said, “To delight in Nirvana and not delight in the world make a duality. If one does not delight in Nirvana and does not have disgust for the world, then there are not two. How so? If there is bondage, then there is liberation. If originally there is no bondage, then who is there to seek liberation? Being without bondage and without liberation, thus without delight or disgust, is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”     

### 珠頂王菩薩曰：「正道、邪道為二。住正道者，則不分別是邪是正，離此二者，是為入不二法門。」

Jewel Crown King Bodhisattva (Mānikuṭārāja) said, “The Right Way and the wrong way make a duality. One who abides in the Right Way does not differentiate between what is wrong and right. Transcending these two is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 樂實菩薩曰：「實、不實為二。實見者尚不見實，何況非實！所以者何？非肉眼所見，慧眼乃能見，而此慧眼，無見無不見，是為入不二法門。」

Delight in Reality Bodhisattva (Satyarata) said, “Real (*satya*) and not real make a duality. One who really sees does not even see what is reality, how much more so what is not reality? How so? The Eye of Wisdom sees what the eye of flesh cannot, and this Eye of Wisdom that is without seeing and without not seeing is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 如是諸菩薩各各說已，問文殊師利：「何等是菩薩入不二法門？」

When all the bodhisattvas had each explained like this they asked Mañjuśrī, “How does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality?”  

### 文殊師利曰：「如我意者，於一切法無言無說，無示無識，離諸問答，是為入不二法門。」

Mañjuśrī said, “As I understand it, being without words and without explanation, without indication and without consciousness, transcending all questions and answers is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.” 

### 於是文殊師利問維摩詰：「我等各自說已，仁者當說何等是菩薩入不二法門？」

At this, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “We have each now explained. Will the venerable now explain how this bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality?” **

### 時維摩詰默然無言。

Vimalakīrti was silent, remaining speechless. 

### 文殊師利歎曰：「善哉！善哉！乃至無有文字、語言，是真入不二法門。」

Mañjuśrī sighed and said, “Excellent! Excellent! Not even a word, not a syllable is truly entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

### 說是入不二法門品時，於此眾中，五千菩薩皆入不二法門，得無生法忍。

When this chapter on entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality was explained, five thousand bodhisattvas among those assembled all entered the Dharma Door of Nonduality and attained the patient tolerance of the non-arising of dharmas.
