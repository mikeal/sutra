### 如是我聞：

Thus have I heard: 

### 一時，薄伽梵住最勝光曜七寶莊嚴，放大光明，普照一切無邊世界，無量方所妙飾間列，周圓無際，其量難測，超過三界所行之處，勝出世間善根所起，最極自在淨識為相。如來所都，諸大菩薩眾所雲集，無量天、龍、藥叉、健達縛、阿素洛、揭路茶、緊捺洛、牟呼洛伽、人、非人等，常所翼從，廣大法味喜樂所持，作諸眾生一切義利，滅諸煩惱災橫纏垢，遠離眾魔、過諸莊嚴，如來莊嚴之所依處，大念、慧、行以為遊路，大止妙觀以為所乘，大空、無相、無願解脫為所入門，無量功德眾所莊嚴，大寶花王眾所建立大宮殿中。

One time, the Bhagavān was abiding in an utterly radiant palace, adorned with the seven treasures, wherein a great light illuminated universally boundless world-systems, beautiful and arranged marvelously throughout immeasurable directions, totally, completely, limitlessly, their measure difficult to calculate, transcending anything found in the Triple Realm, having supremely left the world by [way of] virtuous roots. A most extremely sovereign pure consciousness was the [only] characteristic. In such a domain of the Thus Come One, all the great bodhisattvas gather together like clouds, immeasurable *devas*, *nagas*, *yaksas*, *gandharavas*, *asuras*, *garudas*, *kimnaras*, *mahoragas*, humans, nonhumans, and all others, forever ‘birds of a feather’, the flavor of the broad, great Dharma sustaining their joy and delight, bringing about benefit for all sentient beings, putting an end to oppressive afflictions and restricting defilements, escaping the hordes of Mara, and surpassing all [worldly] adornments. Wherever there are such adornments of the Thus Come One, the practices of great Mindfulness (*smrti*) and Wisdom (*prajna*) are the pathways. Great Stopping (*samatha*) and subtle Observation (*vipasyana*) are the vehicles. Liberation by great Emptiness, Characteristiclessness, and Wishlessness are the gateways, [all] decorated by immeasurable virtues, created by the gathering of the Great Jewel Flower King.       

### 是薄伽梵最清淨覺，不二現行，趣無相法。住於佛住逮得一切佛平等性，到無障處，不可轉法，所行無礙，其所成立不可思議。遊於三世平等法性，其身流布一切世界，於一切法智無疑滯，於一切行成就大覺，於諸法智無有疑惑，凡所現身不可分別，一切菩薩正所求智，得佛無二住勝彼岸，不相間雜。如來解脫妙智究竟，證無中邊佛地平等，極於法界，盡虛空性窮未來際。

This Bhagavān was supremely, purely enlightened, manifesting a non-dual practice that brings about the Characteristicless Dharma. Abiding in the Abode of Buddha where the equal nature of all buddhas is realized, arriving where there are no hindrances, [where] the irreversible Dharma is practiced without obstruction, that which he established is inconceivable. Roaming throughout the equanimous dharmic nature of Triple World, his body saturates all worlds. By doubtless, unblocked knowledge of every *dharma*, by the perfect accomplishment of every practice, with undeluded, doubtless knowledge of all *dharmas* that manifests un-differentiate-able bodies, the knowledge bodhisattvas correctly seek, that victorious far shore of the Buddha’s nondual abode was attained, without the mixing-up of characteristics. The subtle knowledge of the liberation of the Thus Come One having been fulfilled, the equality of all Buddha lands (’stages’ or ‘grounds) without middle or extremes is realized, reaching the ultimate extent of the Dharmadhatu, exhausting [even] the nature of space, never coming to an end.             

### 與無量大聲聞眾俱，一切調順，皆是佛子，心善解脫，慧善解脫，戒善清淨，趣求法樂；多聞、聞持，其聞積集；善思所思，善說所說，善作所作；捷慧、速慧、利慧、出慧、勝決擇慧、大慧、廣慧、及無等慧，慧寶成就；具足三明，逮得第一現法樂住；大淨福田，威儀寂靜，無不圓滿；大忍柔和，成就無減，已善奉行如來聖教。

Also gathered was an immeasurable number of great Voice-Hearers, each one disciplined [subdued], all children of the Buddha, well liberated in mind, well liberated in wisdom, well purified in discipline, ever seeking Dharma Joy. Having heard much, having retained what they heard, their learning was well gathered. Their thoughts were good thoughts, their speech was good speech, and their actions were good actions. Swift wisdom, quick wisdom, beneficial wisdom, ‘far out’ wisdom, honorable wisdom, great wisdom, and equanimous wisdom, perfected wisdom jewels; endowed with the Three Knowledges [*trividyā* - **1. remembering former lives, 2. divine eye of the future, and 3. present knowing of the destruction of contaminants], having arrived at the foremost state of abiding in Dharma Joy; great, pure fields of merit; perfect in their comportment, with nothing unfulfilled; their great patience (*ksanti*) and gentleness complete and unceasing, having already revered and practiced the sagely teachings of the Thus Come One.       

### 復有無量菩薩摩訶薩，從種種佛土而來集會。皆住大乘，遊大乘法，於諸眾生其心平等，離諸分別及不分別種種分別，摧伏一切眾魔怨敵，遠離一切聲聞、獨覺所有作意，廣大法味喜樂所持，超五怖畏，一向趣入不退轉地，息一切眾生一切苦惱所逼迫地，而現在前。其名曰：解甚深義密意菩薩摩訶薩、如理請問菩薩摩訶薩、法涌菩薩摩訶薩、善清淨慧菩薩摩訶薩、廣慧菩薩摩訶薩、德本菩薩摩訶薩、勝義生菩薩摩訶薩、觀自在菩薩摩訶薩、慈氏菩薩摩訶薩、曼殊室利菩薩摩訶薩等，而為上首。

There were also immeasurable numbers of bodhisattva mahasattvas, having come from various Buddha lands. They all abided in the Great Vehicle, traveling [in] the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, their minds equanimous toward all sentient beings, free from discriminating and/or not discriminating the various kinds of discriminations, conquering all the enmity of hordes of Maras, going beyond the minds of all Voice Hearers and the Solitary Awakened, sustained by the joy of the flavor of the broad, great Dharma, transcending the Five Dreads, destined to enter the non-regressing stage, where the stressful stages of all sentient beings and all afflictions appearing before them are calmed.
