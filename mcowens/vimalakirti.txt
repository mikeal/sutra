>>> 佛道品第八
<<< THE WAY OF THE BUDDHA
>>> 爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：「菩薩云何通達佛道？」
<<< At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “ How do bodhisattvas enter the Way of the Buddha?” 
>>> 維摩詰言：「若菩薩行於非道，是為通達佛道。」
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “If bodhisattvas practice (tread, walk, act, behave, condition, etc..) where there is no way, this is to enter the Way of the Buddha.”
>>> 又問：「云何菩薩行於非道？」
<<< [Mañjuśrī ] again asked, “How do bodhisattvas practice where there is no way?”
>>> 答曰：「若菩薩行五無間，而無惱恚；至于地獄，無諸罪垢；至于畜生，無有無明憍慢等過；至于餓鬼，而具足功德；行色、無色界道，不以為勝。示行貪欲，離諸染著；示行瞋恚，於諸眾生，無有恚閡；示行愚癡，而以智慧，調伏其心。示行慳貪，而捨內外所有，不惜身命；示行毀禁，而安住淨戒，乃至小罪，猶懷大懼；示行瞋恚，而常慈忍；示行懈怠，而懃修功德；示行亂意，而常念定；示行愚癡，而通達世間、出世間慧；示行諂偽，而善方便，隨諸經義；示行憍慢，而於眾生，猶如橋梁；示行諸煩惱，而心常清淨；示入於魔，而順佛智慧，不隨他教；示入聲聞，而為眾生，說未聞法；示入辟支佛，而成就大悲，教化眾生；示入貧窮，而有寶手，功德無盡；示入刑殘，而具諸相好，以自莊嚴；示入下賤，而生佛種姓中，具諸功德；示入羸劣醜陋，而得那羅延身，一切眾生之所樂見；示入老病，而永斷病根，超越死畏；示有資生，而恒觀無常，實無所貪；示有妻妾采女，而常遠離五欲淤泥；現於訥鈍，而成就辯才，總持無失；示入邪濟，而以正濟，度諸眾生；現遍入諸道，而斷其因緣；現於涅槃，而不斷生死。文殊師利！菩薩能如是行於非道，是為通達佛道。」
<<< [Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “If bodhisattvas commit the Five Interminables (pañcānantarya), yet are without the affliction of hatred; arrive in a hell realm without the defilement of transgression; are reborn as animals without faults such as ignorance and conceit; arrive [as] hungry ghosts, yet are replete with merit; and practice (walk) ways (paths) within the realms of Form and Formlessness without considering it a victory; appear to act desirously, free of all defiling attachments; appear to act angry toward all sentient beings, without there being animosity; and appear to act ignorantly and confused, yet use wisdom to discipline their minds. Appear to act greedily, yet relinquish both interior and exterior existents without begrudging the body or life; Appear to be transgressive, yet peacefully abide in pure precepts so that even the slightest fault is considered something to be greatly feared; Appear to act hatefully, yet constantly [practice] patient tolerance (kṣānti); Appear to be lazy (kausīdya), yet diligently cultivate merit; Appear to act scatterbrained, yet are ever mindfully attentive; Appear to be ignorant, yet penetrate both mundane and transcendent wisdom; Appear to be flattering and fake, yet with excellent skillful means that are in accord with the meaning of all the sutras; Appear to be arrogant, yet are like bridges to sentient beings; Appear to behave with all of the afflictions, yet have ever pure minds; Appear to become Māras, yet heed the wisdom of the Buddha, not following another teaching; Appear to become voice-hearers, yet explain Dharma not heard before for sentient beings; Appear to become pratyekabuddhas, yet accomplish the Great Compassion and teach sentient beings; Appear to become poor, yet have the ‘Jewel Hand’ of inexhaustible merit; Appear to become maimed and/or crippled, yet become ‘self adorned’ with all of the auspicious characteristics; Appear to become lowly, yet are born within the lineage (family, seed, kind) of the Buddhas, replete with all merit; Appear to become feeble and ugly, yet have the body of Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu), which all sentient beings enjoy seeing; Appear to become old and sick, yet have eternally cut off the root of illness and transcend the fear of death; Appear to have wealth, yet only observe impermanence, truly without any desire; Appear to have spouses and lovers, yet are ever free of the filth of the mire of the five desires; Manifest as mute and dumb, yet accomplish eloquence and [dhāraṇī] retention without error; Appear to be false ‘crossings’, yet are proper (correct) ‘crossings’ by delivering (’saving’, liberating) all sentient beings; Manifest entering all destinies, yet cut off their conditionality; Manifest entering Nirvana, yet without cutting off birth & death. Mañjuśrī! Bodhisattvas able to ‘walk’ where there is no way like this, this is to enter the Way of the Buddha.”
>>> 於是維摩詰問文殊師利：「何等為如來種？」
<<< At this, Vimalakīrti asked Mañjuśrī: “What are the ‘seeds’ (lineage, family, kind) of the Thus Come One (tathāgata-vaṃśa)?”
>>> 文殊師利言：「有身為種，無明有愛為種，貪恚癡為種，四顛倒為種，五蓋為種，六入為種，七識處為種，八邪法為種，九惱處為種，十不善道為種。以要言之，六十二見及一切煩惱，皆是佛種。」
<<< Mañjuśrī said, “Having a body is a seed. Ignorance and Desire are seeds. Attraction, Aversion and Confusion [the ‘three poisons’] are seeds. The Four Inversions are seeds. The Five Aggregates are seeds. The Six Entrances (senses) are seeds. The Seven Bases of Consciousnesses are seeds. The Eight Ignoble Dharmas are seeds. The Nine Bases of Affliction are seeds. The Ten Non-Virtuous Ways are seeds. Essentially speaking, the Sixty-Two [erroneous] Views and each of the Afflictions are all the seeds of Buddha[hood].”
>>> 曰：「何謂也？」
<<< Vimalakīrti replied, “Which is to say what?”
>>> 答曰：「若見無為入正位者，不能復發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心；譬如高原陸地，不生蓮華，卑濕淤泥乃生此華；如是見無為法入正位者，終不復能生於佛法；煩惱泥中，乃有眾生起佛法耳！又如殖種於空，終不得生！糞壤之地，乃能滋茂。如是入無為正位者，不生佛法；起於我見如須彌山，猶能發于阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，生佛法矣！是故當知，一切煩惱，為如來種。譬如不下巨海，不能得無價寶珠。如是不入煩惱大海，則不能得一切智寶。」
<<< [Mañjuśrī] replied saying, “One who enters Correct Understanding, seeing the Unconditioned, is unable to attain anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi citta. Just as the dry land on a high plateau will not give rise to a lotus flower, a flower that grows in the mud and mire of low-lying places; Like this, those who enter Correct Understanding seeing the Unconditioned are forever unable to give rise to Buddha Dharma. It is only within the mud of the afflictions that sentient beings give rise to Buddha Dharma! It is also like planting a seed in the air, it will never germinate! Only in manure-enriched earth can it sprout and flourish. Like this, one who enters the Unconditioned Correct Understanding will not give rise to Buddha Dharma. It is only when one brings forth the view of themselves as being like Mt. Sumeru that they are able to generate the intention to achieve anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi citta, and give rise to Buddha Dharma. For this reason you should know, each of the afflictions are seeds of the Thus Come One. It is just like not going to the depths of the ocean, you will be unable to attain priceless jewel-pearls. Like this, if you do not enter the Great Sea of Afflictions, then you will be unable to attain any Jewels of Wisdom.                
>>> 爾時大迦葉歎言：「善哉，善哉！文殊師利！快說此語。誠如所言，塵勞之疇為如來種；我等今者，不復堪任發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，乃至五無間罪，猶能發意生於佛法，而今我等永不能發。譬如根敗之士，其於五欲不能復利。如是聲聞諸結斷者，於佛法中無所復益，永不志願。是故，文殊師利！凡夫於佛法有返復，而聲聞無也。所以者何？凡夫聞佛法，能起無上道心，不斷三寶。正使聲聞終身聞佛法，力、無畏等，永不能發無上道意。」
<<< At that time Mahākāśyapa sighed and said, “Excellent! Excellent! Mañjuśrī! These words aptly explain. Indeed, as you have said, the field of troublesome ‘dust’ is the seed of the Thus Come One. Now, we are no longer able to bear generating anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi citta. Even those who commit the Five Interminables could generate such a mind toward Buddha Dharma, however we now will forever never be able to generate [bodhi citta]. Just like someone with impaired faculties, unable to benefit from the five (sense) pleasures. Like this, Voice Hearers who have cut off all fetters are without any benefit though being among all the Buddha Dharma, and will never have a will to be so. For this reason, Mañjuśrī! The ordinary person has a response to Buddha Dharma, yet the Voice Hearer is without one. How is it so? An ordinary person hears the Buddha Dharma and they are able to give rise to an unsurpassable mind of enlightenment, without cutting off the Three Jewels. Even if a Voice Hearer spent their entire life hearing about the Dharmas of Buddha, the Powers, the Fearlessnesses, etc., they would be forever unable to generate a thought of unsurpassable enlightenment.”
>>> 爾時會中有菩薩，名普現色身，問維摩詰言：「居士！父母妻子、親戚眷屬、吏民知識，悉為是誰？奴婢僮僕、象馬車乘，皆何所在？」
<<< Then, among the assembly a bodhisattva called Universally Manifesting Form Body (Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana) asked Vimalakīrti, “Householder (Kulapati)! Father, mother, spouse and child, kinfolk and acquaintances, messengers and friends, who are they? Your attendants and servants, elephants and horses, carriages and vehicles, where are they all?”

A sense of shame is their upper garment
A profound mind their flower mala [wreath, headdress]

<<< PRACTICES OF THE BODHISATTVA
>>> 是時佛說法於菴羅樹園，其地忽然廣博嚴事，一切眾會皆作金色。阿難白佛言：「世尊！以何因緣，有此瑞應？是處忽然廣博嚴事，一切眾會皆作金色。」
<<< At that time, the Buddha was in the Āmrapālī Garden explaining the Dharma, when the ground suddenly became broad and beautifully adorned, and everyone in the assembly all became the color of gold. Ānanda asked the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What are the ‘causes and conditions’ of these auspicious signs? The ground suddenly becoming broad and beautifully adorned, and everyone in the assembly all becoming the color of gold.”
>>> 佛告阿難：「是維摩詰、文殊師利，與諸大眾恭敬圍繞，發意欲來，故先為此瑞應。」
<<< The Buddha told Ānanda, “Vimalakīrti, Mañjuśrī, along with a great assembly that surrounds and honors them, are generating thoughts wishing to come [here], and so there first appears these auspicious signs.”
>>> 於是維摩詰語文殊師利：「可共見佛，與諸菩薩禮事供養。」
<<< At this, Vimalakīrti said to Mañjuśrī, “We should go together to see the Buddha and, along with all the bodhisattvas, to worship and make offerings.”
>>> 文殊師利言：「善哉！行矣！今正是時。」
<<< Mañjuśrī replied, “Excellent! Let’s go! Now is the time.”
>>> 維摩詰即以神力，持諸大眾并師子座，置於右掌，往詣佛所。到已著地，稽首佛足，右遶七匝，一心合掌，在一面立；其諸菩薩即皆避座，稽首佛足，亦繞七匝，於一面立；諸大弟子、釋、梵、四天王等，亦皆避座，稽首佛足，在一面立。
<<< Vimalakīrti then used his spiritual powers to hold the entire great congregation along with their lion throne seats in his right hand and proceeded to where the Buddha. Upon arriving, he placed them on the ground, bowed his head to the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him seven times to the right and, holding his palms together singlemindedly, stood to one side. The bodhisattvas all got up from their seats and bowed their heads to the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him seven times, and stood to one side. The great disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, four heavenly kings, and so on, also all got up from their seats, bowed their heads to the Buddha’s feet, and stood to one side.”
>>> 於是世尊如法慰問諸菩薩已，各令復坐，即皆受教。眾坐已定，佛語舍利弗：「汝見菩薩大士，自在神力之所為乎？」
<<< Then the World-honored One, according to dharmic custom, requested that the bodhisattvas all sit once again, and they all followed these instructions. When the congregation was seated they entered concentration, and the Buddha said to Śāriputra, “Have you seen what this bodhisattva,
this great being, can do with his sovereign spiritual power?”
>>> 「唯然，已見！」
<<< “Yes, I have seen!”
>>> 「於汝意云何？」「世尊！我覩其為不可思議，非意所圖，非度所測。」
<<< “What do you think of it?”

“World-honored One, I see what has been done as inconceivable, not something the mind can chart, beyond estimation.”

<<< The Buddha told Ānanda, “It is the fragrance of these bodhisattvas’ hair pores.”

>>> 阿難問維摩詰：「是香氣住當久如？」
<<< Ānanda inquired of Vimalakīrti saying, “How long will this fragrance last?”
>>> 維摩詰言：「至此飯消。」
<<< Vimalakīrti  replied, “Until the food is digested.”
>>> 曰：「此飯久如當消？」
<<< [Ānanda] replied, “How long does this food take to digest?”
>>> 曰：「此飯勢力至于七日，然後乃消。又阿難！若聲聞人未入正位，食此飯者，得入正位，然後乃消；已入正位，食此飯者，得心解脫，然後乃消；若未發大乘意，食此飯者，至發意乃消；已發意食此飯者，得無生忍，然後乃消；已得無生忍，食此飯者，至一生補處，然後乃消。譬如有藥，名曰上味，其有服者，身諸毒滅，然後乃消。此飯如是，滅除一切諸煩惱毒，然後乃消。」
<<< [Vimalakīrti] replied, “The vitality of this food remains for seven days, after which it is digested. Furthermore, Ānanda! If voice hearers who have not yet entered correct establishment eat this food, it will only be digested after they enter correct establishment. If they have already entered correct establishment and they eat this food, it will only be digested after the mind is liberated. If those who have not generated the thought of the Great Vehicle eat this food, it will only be digested after they arrived at generating the thought. If they have already generated the thought and they eat this food, it will only be digested after they have attained the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of all dharmas. If they have already attained the patient tolerance for the birthlessness of all dharmas and they eat this food, it will only be digested after they have arrived at the station of those who have only one more rebirth. It is just like the medicine called Superior Flavor. It is with the one who eats it as the body eliminates all poisons, after which it is digested. This food is like this, eliminating all the poisonous afflictions, after which it is digested.”
>>> 阿難白佛言：「未曾有也，世尊！如此香飯能作佛事。」
<<< Ānanda addressed the Buddha saying, “Unprecedented, World-Honored One! Scented food like, capable of performing the work of the Buddha.”
>>> 佛言：「如是，如是！阿難！或有佛土以佛光明而作佛事，有以諸菩薩而作佛事，有以佛所化人而作佛事，有以菩提樹而作佛事，有以佛衣服、臥具而作佛事，有以飯食而作佛事，有以園林臺觀而作佛事，有以三十二相、八十隨形好而作佛事，有以佛身而作佛事，有以虛空而作佛事；眾生應以此緣得入律行。有以夢、幻、影、響、鏡中像、水中月、熱時炎，如是等喻而作佛事。有以音聲、語言、文字而作佛事。或有清淨佛土、寂寞無言、無說、無示、無識、無作、無為，而作佛事。如是，阿難！諸佛威儀進止，諸所施為，無非佛事。
<<< The Buddha replied, “So it is, so it is! Ānanda! There are buddha lands where the light of the Buddha performs the work of the Buddha, or where bodhisattvas perform the work of the Buddha, or where transformational people created by the Buddha perform the work of the Buddha, or where the Bodhi Tree performs the work of the Buddha, or where the Buddha’s clothing and bedding perform the work of the Buddha, or where food performs the work of the Buddha, or where groves and pavilions perform the Buddha’s work, or where the thirty-two characteristics and eighty subsidiary marks perform the work of the Buddha, or where the Buddha’s body performs the work of the Buddha, or where space performs the work of the Buddha, [wherever it is], sentient beings respond to these conditions and attain entry into the practice of the Discipline. There are those where dreams, illusions, shadows, echoes, images in a mirror, the moon in [the surfaces of] waters, mirages in the heat, and other such analogies as these perform the work of the Buddha. There are those sounds, speech, and writing perform the work of the Buddha. Or there are those pure Buddha Lands, tranquil and without words, without speech, without demonstration, without consciousness, without doing, without effort [conditioning, wu-wei], yet performing the work of the Buddha. Thus, Ānanda! All Buddhas, in their respect-inspiring deportment, drive, and composure, with everything they give, there is nothing that is not the work of the Buddha.”
>>> 「阿難！有此四魔，八萬四千諸煩惱門，而諸眾生為之疲勞，諸佛即以此法而作佛事，是名入一切諸佛法門。菩薩入此門者，若見一切淨好佛土，不以為喜，不貪不高；若見一切不淨佛土，不以為憂，不礙不沒；但於諸佛生清淨心，歡喜恭敬，未曾有也！諸佛如來功德平等！為化眾生故，而現佛土不同。阿難！汝見諸佛國土，地有若干，而虛空無若干也；如是見諸佛色身有若干耳，其無礙慧無若干也。
<<< “Ānanda! There are these four Maras and eighty-four thousand gateways to all the afflictions that cause all sentient beings to be wearied and troubled. All Buddha’s use these things to perform the work of a Buddha. This is called entering the gateway of everything being Buddha Dharma. Bodhisattvas who enter this gateway, if they see all the pure, wonderous Buddha Lands, they do not feel joy, or want, or elation (’high’). If they see all the impure Buddha Lands, they do not feel grief, or obstruction, or depression (’low’). They just give rise to a pure mind toward all Buddhas, joyfully reverent, like never before! The equanimity of the merit of all Buddha, Thus Come Ones! In order to transform sentient beings they manifest different Buddha Lands. Ānanda! Look at the lands of all the buddha countries, the ground has differences but space is without any difference. Like this, see all the bodies of form of the buddhas as having their differences, while their unobstructed wisdom is without any difference.”

Ananda! If I fully explained the meaning of these three words, even if you lived as long as a kalpa, I would still be unable to exhaustively tell you. Even if all the sentient beings in a Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system were just like Ānanda - foremost (’number one’) in hearing (learning), having attained retentive mindfulness (dhāraṇī) - and these people all had life-spans also a kalpa long, I would be unable to tell them. Thus, Ānanda! The anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi of all buddhas is without limit or measure, their wisdom and eloquence cannot be conceived.

<<< The Buddha told Ānanda, “Do not be discouraged! Why? I have said that you are the highest, most learned among voice-hearers, not among bodhisattvas. But stop, Ānanda! One who has wisdom should not evaluate the bodhisattvas, for the depths of an ocean may be measured, [but] the bodhisattvas dhyana, prajñā, dhāraṇīs, eloquence and all their virtues cannot be measured. Ānanda! You [voice-hearers] have forsaken the practices of bodhisattvas. The manifestation of mystical powers by Vimalakīrti this one time, all the voice-hearers and solitary-buddhas would be unable to do with all their powers of extinguishment and transformation in hundreds of thousands of kalpas.”

<<< At that time, the bodhisattvas from the world-system Gathered Fragrances joined their palms and addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! When we first saw this land, we perceived it as being inferior. Now we feel ashamed of ourselves and let go of this way of thinking. How so? The upaya of all buddhas are inconceivable! In order to liberate sentient beings, in accordance with their inclinations, are manifest different buddha lands. And so, World-Honored One! Bestow upon us a little Dharma, as we return to that other world, we will remember the Thus Come One.”

What is the exhaustible (or destructible)? Conditioned dharma. What is the inexhaustible (or indestructible)? Unconditioned dharma. To be like a bodhisattva is to not exhaust (destroy) the conditioned, and to not abide in the unconditioned.”
>>> 「何謂不盡有為？謂不離大慈，不捨大悲；深發一切智心，而不忽忘；教化眾生，終不厭倦；於四攝法，常念順行；護持正法，不惜軀命；種諸善根，無有疲厭。志常安住，方便迴向；求法不懈，說法無悋；勤供諸佛。故入生死而無所畏；於諸榮辱，心無憂喜；不輕未學，敬學如佛；墮煩惱者，令發正念，於遠離樂，不以為貴；不著己樂，慶於彼樂。在諸禪定，如地獄想；於生死中，如園觀想；見來求者，為善師想；捨諸所有，具一切智想；見毀戒人，起救護想；諸波羅蜜，為父母想；道品之法，為眷屬想。發行善根，無有齊限；以諸淨國嚴飾之事，成己佛土；行無限施，具足相好；除一切惡，淨身口意。生死無數劫，意而有勇；聞佛無量德，志而不倦。以智慧劍，破煩惱賊；出陰界入，荷負眾生，永使解脫。以大精進，摧伏魔軍，常求無念實相智慧行；於世間法少欲知足，於出世間求之無厭，而不捨世間法，不壞威儀法而能隨俗。起神通慧，引導眾生，得念總持，所聞不忘。善別諸根，斷眾生疑；以樂說辯，演法無礙。淨十善道，受天、人福；修四無量，開梵天道。勸請說法，隨喜讚善，得佛音聲；身口意善，得佛威儀。深修善法，所行轉勝；以大乘教，成菩薩僧；心無放逸，不失眾善。行如此法，是名菩薩不盡有為。
<<< What is not exhausting (destroying) the conditioned? It is not abandoning great kindness, and not relinquishing great compassion; It is profoundly generating the aspiration for All-Knowledge and never forgetting it; It is teaching and transforming sentient beings, never growing weary; It is, in regard to the Four Means of Unification, always being mindful and in accord with them; It is protecting the Correct Dharma, not fearing for necessities; It is cultivating all good roots without becoming fatigued; It is the resolve to peacefully abide, upaya-ically transferring; It is seeking all Dharma without laziness, and explaining the Dharma without pedantry, and it is praising all Buddhas. Due to entering Birth & Death, it is being fearless; It is a mind without grief or joy about honor or disgrace; It is not belittling the unlearned and to revere the learned as Buddhas; It is causing those who have fallen into the afflictions to generate correct mindfulness, abandon and transcend pleasures and not consider things as rare; It is being in dhyāna with the perception that it is the hell realms; It is being in Birth & Death with the perception that it is a garden for observing; It is seeing someone who comes seeking with the perception that it is an excellent teacher; It is relinquishing all that exists with the perception that one is replete with All-Knowledge; It is seeing those who transgress the rules with the perception of wanting to protect them; It is perceiving the pāramitās as father and mother; It is perceiving the Dharmas of the elements of the Path as one’s retinue. It is generating the practice of good roots without limitations; It is having already achieved a buddha land by adorning and decorating Pure Lands; It is practicing limitless giving, becoming replete with [the] auspicious characteristics; It is being rid of all evil, pure in body, speech, and mind. [Throughout] immeasurable kalpas of birth and death, it is the Mind with courage; It is being resolved upon hearing of the immeasurable virtues of the Buddha, and never growing weary; It is defeating the bandits of the afflictions with the sword of wisdom; It is departing from the Aggregates, Realms, and Entrances, and shouldering the burden of sentient beings, ever bring them to liberation. It is defeating the armies of Mara with Great Vīrya and constantly seeking the prajñā practice of the True Characteristic without mindfulness; It is having little desire for worldly things (dharmas) and tirelessly seeking transcendent things yet without rejecting worldly things, and not destroying the dignified deportment(s) of the Dharma, therefore being in accord with them; It is bringing about super-knowledge to guide sentient beings, attaining retentive (dhāraṇī) memory and not forgetting [anything] heard; It is well discerning people’s faculties and cutting off their doubt; It is proclaiming the Dharma widely without obstruction by joyful eloquence; It is receiving the fortune of gods and humans from the pure Way of the Ten Excellences; It is opening the way to Brahma’s Heaven by cultivating the Four Immeasurables; It is to request explanations of the Dharma and rejoice in hearing the voice of the Buddha; It is being excellent in body, speech, and mind and attaining the dignified deportment of a buddha; It is the turning to victory from the practice of the profound cultivation of the Good Dharma; It is creating a Bodhisattva Sangha from the teachings of the Great Vehicle; It is a mind without distraction, never missing an opportunity to gather goodness. Dharma practiced like this is called the bodhisattva not exhausting the conditioned.
>>> 「何謂菩薩不住無為？謂修學空，不以空為證；修學無相、無作，不以無相、無作為證；修學無起，不以無起為證。觀於無常，而不厭善本；觀世間苦，而不惡生死；觀於無我，而誨人不倦；觀於寂滅，而不永滅；觀於遠離，而身心修善；觀無所歸，而歸趣善法；觀於無生，而以生法荷負一切；觀於無漏，而不斷諸漏；觀無所行，而以行法教化眾生；觀於空無，而不捨大悲；觀正法位，而不隨小乘；觀諸法虛妄，無牢無人、無主無相，本願未滿，而不虛福德、禪定、智慧。修如此法，是名菩薩不住無為。
<<< “What is the bodhisattva not abiding in the unconditioned? It is studying emptiness, but not taking  emptiness to be realization; It is studying characteristiclessness and aimlessness, but not taking characteristiclessness or aimlessness to be realization; It is studying the unarisen, but not taking the unarisen to be realization. It is being observant of impermanence, yet not turned off by good roots; It is being observant of the suffering of the world, yet not considering birth and death evil; It is to be observant that there is no self, yet guiding others tirelessly; It is to be observant of quiescent cessation, yet not being forever ceased; It is to be observant of transcendence, yet the body and mind cultivate goodness; It is to be observant that there is no returning, yet returning to the Good Dharma; It is to be observant of non-origination, yet baring the burden of everything by giving rise to the Dharma; It is to be observant without any practice, yet transforming sentient beings by practicing the Dharma; It is to be observant of emptiness and nonexistence, yet not relinquishing Great Compassion; It is to be observant of the correctly established Dharma, yet not going along with the lesser vehicle; It is to be observant that all dharmas are empty and false, without firmness and without personhood, without a ‘chief’ and without characteristics, the original vow not yet fulfilled, yet merit, meditation, and wisdom are not in vain.

For the accumulation of Dharma medicine, it is not abiding in the unconditioned; for administering the appropriate medicine, it is not extinguishing the conditioned.

<<< At that time those bodhisattvas, having heard the explanation of this Dharma, were filled with great delight and gathered many wonderful flowers from those of various colors and various fragrances, scattering them throughout the Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system, offering them to the Buddha and to this sutra-dharma, as well as to the bodhisattvas, bowing their heads to the Buddha's feet and sighing at having heard what they had never heard before. They exclaimed, "Shakyamuni Buddha is able to skillfully employ upāya!" Having said this, they suddenly disappeared, returning to their country.

>>> 爾時佛告文殊師利：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」
<<< Then the Buddha said to Mañjuśrī, “You should go visit Vimalakīrti and inquire about his illness.”
>>> 文殊師利白佛言：「世尊！彼上人者，難為詶對。深達實相，善說法要，辯才無滯，智慧無礙；一切菩薩法式悉知，諸佛祕藏無不得入；降伏眾魔，遊戲神通，其慧方便，皆已得度。雖然，當承佛聖旨，詣彼問疾。」
<<< Mañjuśrī replied to the Buddha saying, “World Honored One! That is a superior person, difficult to approach [discourse with]. He has deeply penetrated the True Characteristic, and is good at explaining the essentials of the Dharma. With unhindered eloquence, his wisdom is unobstructed. He thoroughly understands all the dharma and style of bodhisattvas and has entered into the secret treasuries of all the buddhas without attainment. Subjugator of Māras, he plays (vikrīḍita) with the super powers. His prajñā is upayic - having totally attained liberation. **Nevertheless, I will accept the Buddha’s sagely request and proceed to inquire about his illness.”
>>> 於是眾中諸菩薩、大弟子、釋、梵、四天王等，咸作是念：「今二大士，文殊師利、維摩詰共談，必說妙法！」即時八千菩薩、五百聲聞、百千天、人皆欲隨從。
<<< Then the bodhisattvas and major disciples in the assembly, the Brahmas, Indras, and Four Heavenly Kings, all thought to themselves: ‘Now these two great men, Mañjuśrī and Vimalakirti, will be talking together, and they will surely explain the subtle Dharma!" At that time eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred voice-hearers, and hundreds and thousands of heavenly and human beings all wished to follow along.
>>> 於是文殊師利與諸菩薩、大弟子眾及諸天、人，恭敬圍繞，入毘耶離大城。
<<< Then Mañjuśrī, with all the bodhisattvas, major disciples, and human and heavenly beings reverently surrounding and accompanying him, proceeded to enter the great city of Vaishali.
>>> 爾時長者維摩詰心念：「今文殊師利與大眾俱來！」即以神力空其室內，除去所有及諸侍者；唯置一床，以疾而臥。
<<< At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti pondered, ‘Mañjuśrī and a great company are now coming!’ Then, by spiritual power, he ‘emptied’ his house, and everything there was was gone, even the assistants. The only thing left standing was a bed upon which the ill reclined.
>>> 文殊師利既入其舍，見其室空，無諸所有，獨寢一床。時維摩詰言：「善來，文殊師利！不來相而來，不見相而見。」
<<< When Mañjuśrī entered the house he saw that it had been emptied, without anything there, only a bed ‘resting’.

Then Vimalakīrti said, ‘Well come, Mañjuśrī! You arrive with the characteristic of not arriving; You are seen with the characteristic of not being seen.’
>>> 文殊師利言：「如是！居士！若來已，更不來；若去已，更不去。所以者何？來者無所從來，去者無所至，所可見者，更不可見。且置是事，居士！是疾寧可忍不？療治有損，不至增乎！世尊慇懃致問無量，居士是疾，何所因起？其生久如？當云何滅？」
<<< Mañjuśrī replied, ‘So it is! Householder (Kulapati)! What has already arrived has no more arriving; what has departed has no more departing. How so? That which arrives has nowhere to come from, that which is gone has nowhere to go, that which can be seen, is no more seen. But enough of these things (going’s ons), Kulapati, this illness. Is it tolerable? Is the treatment having an effect? Say it hasn’t increased!”
>>> 維摩詰言：「從癡、有愛，則我病生。以一切眾生病，是故我病；若一切眾生病滅，則我病滅。所以者何？菩薩為眾生故入生死，有生死則有病；若眾生得離病者，則菩薩無復病。譬如長者，唯有一子，其子得病，父母亦病。若子病愈，父母亦愈。菩薩如是，於諸眾生，愛之若子；眾生病則菩薩病，眾生病愈，菩薩亦愈。又言是疾，何所因起？菩薩病者，以大悲起。」
<<< Vimalakīrti replied, “From confusion there is love (’lust’), then my illness arises. It is because all sentient beings are ill that I am ill. If all sentient beings’ illness ceases, then my illness ceases. How is that? The bodhisattva enters birth & death (saṃsāra) for all sentient beings. Having birth & death [i.e. being in saṃsāra], then there is illness. If sentient beings attain freedom from illness, then the bodhisattva is without further illness. Just like parents, whose only child becomes ill. The father and mother are also ill. If the child’s illness feels better, the father and mother also feel better. It could also be asked of this illness, how does it come about? The bodhisattva’s illness comes about through great compassion.”
>>> 文殊師利言：「居士此室，何以空無侍者？」
<<< Mañjuśrī said, “Kulapati, this room, how is it empty, without assistants?”
>>> 維摩詰言：「諸佛國土亦復皆空。」
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “The lands of all buddha lands are also entirely empty.”
>>> 又問：「以何為空？」
<<< Again he asked, “What is empty?”
>>> 答曰：「以空空。」
<<< He replied saying, “Emptiness is empty.”
>>> 又問：「空何用空？」
<<< Again he asked, “How can emptiness be empty?”
>>> 答曰：「以無分別空故空。」
<<< He replied saying, “By not differentiating (nirvikalpa) emptiness, there is emptiness.”
>>> 又問：「空可分別耶？」
<<< Again he asked, “Emptiness can be differentiated?
>>> 答曰：「分別亦空。」
<<< He replied saying, “Differentiation (parikalpa) is also empty.”
>>> 又問：「空當於何求？」
<<< Again he asked, “How should emptiness be sought?”
>>> 答曰：「當於六十二見中求。」
<<< He replied saying, “It should be sought by the 62 [erroneous] views.”
>>> 又問：「六十二見當於何求？」
<<< Again he asked, “How should the 62 views be sought?”
>>> 答曰：「當於諸佛解脫中求。」
<<< He replied saying, “They should be sought within the liberation of all buddhas.”
>>> 又問：「諸佛解脫當於何求？」
<<< Again he asked, “How should the liberation of all buddhas be sought?”
>>> 答曰：「當於一切眾生心行中求。又仁所問：『何無侍者？』一切眾魔及諸外道，皆吾侍也。所以者何？眾魔者樂生死，菩薩於生死而不捨；外道者樂諸見，菩薩於諸見而不動。」
<<< He replied saying, “It should be sought within the conditioned mind of every sentient being. You, sir, also asked ‘How is it without assistants?’ Every horde of Mara and all the outside ways (’heretics’), they are all my assistants. How so? Hordes of Mara delight in birth & death (saṃsāra), whereas the bodhisattva does not relinquish birth & death; those of outside ways delight in views (dṛṣṭi), whereas the bodhisattva is not moved by views.”
>>> 文殊師利言：「居士所疾，為何等相？」

>>> 維摩詰言：「我病無形不可見。」
<<< Vimalakīrti replied, “My illness is without shape, it cannot be seen.”
>>> 又問：「此病身合耶？心合耶？」
<<< Again he asked, “This illness, is it of the body or of the mind?”
>>> 答曰：「非身合，身相離故；亦非心合，心如幻故。」
<<< He replied saying, “It is not of the body, since bodily characteristics are transcendent (departed); and it is also not of the mind, since the mind is like an illusion.”
>>> 又問：「地大、水大、火大、風大，於此四大，何大之病？」
<<< Again he asked, “Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, of these four Great Elements, of which element is this illness?
>>> 答曰：「是病非地大，亦不離地大；水、火、風大，亦復如是。而眾生病，從四大起，以其有病，是故我病。」
<<< He replied saying, “This illness is not of Earth, but it also is not apart from (transcendent of) Earth. Water, Fire, and Wind are also like this. However, the illnesses of sentient beings are from the four Great Elements, and because they have illness, I am ill.
>>> 爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：「菩薩應云何慰喻有疾菩薩？」
<<< Then, Mañjuśrī inquired of Vimalakīrti saying, “How should a bodhisattva comfort bodhisattvas who are ill?”
>>> 維摩詰言：「說身無常，不說厭離於身；說身有苦，不說樂於涅槃；說身無我，而說教導眾生；說身空寂，不說畢竟寂滅；說悔先罪，而不說入於過去；以己之疾，愍於彼疾；當識宿世無數劫苦，當念饒益一切眾生；憶所修福，念於淨命，勿生憂惱，常起精進；當作醫王，療治眾病。菩薩應如是慰喻有疾菩薩，令其歡喜。」
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “Tell them the body is impermanent but don’t tell them to despise the body. Tell them the body is suffering but don’t tell them to take pleasure in Nirvana. Tell them the body is without self, yet tell them to teach and guide sentient beings. Tell them the body is quiescent but don’t tell them of ultimate cessation (ātyantika-nirvāṇa). Tell them of remorse for former transgressions, yet don’t tell them to enter [dwell in] the past. By one’s own illness, comfort the illness of others. One should be conscious of the immeasurable kalpas of past lifetimes of suffering. One should be mindful of benefiting all sentient beings. Remember blessings that have been cultivated. Be mindful of pure livelihood. Never give rise to vexation. Constantly bring forth determination (virya). One should be a Physician King, healing all the various illnesses. Bodhisattvas should comfort bodhisattvas who are ill like this, by making them happy.”      
>>> 文殊師利言：「居士！有疾菩薩云何調伏其心？」
<<< Mañjuśrī said, “Kulapati! Bodhisattvas who are ill, how can they control [tame, discipline, subdue, temper] their minds?”
>>> 維摩詰言：「有疾菩薩應作是念：『今我此病，皆從前世妄想顛倒諸煩惱生，無有實法，誰受病者！所以者何？四大合故，假名為身；四大無主，身亦無我；又此病起，皆由著我。是故於我，不應生著。』既知病本，即除我想及眾生想。當起法想，應作是念：『但以眾法，合成此身；起唯法起，滅唯法滅。又此法者，各不相知，起時不言我起，滅時不言我滅。』彼有疾菩薩為滅法想，當作是念：『此法想者，亦是顛倒，顛倒者是即大患，我應離之。』云何為離？離我、我所。云何離我、我所？謂離二法。云何離二法？謂不念內外諸法行於平等。云何平等？謂我等、涅槃等。所以者何？我及涅槃，此二皆空。以何為空？但以名字故空。如此二法，無決定性，得是平等；無有餘病，唯有空病；空病亦空。是有疾菩薩以無所受而受諸受，未具佛法，亦不滅受而取證也。
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas who are ill should think, ‘This present illness of mine comes entirely from confused, inverted thinking from the past, born of all the afflictions. There is no actual dharma (‘thing’ or phenomena) that experiences illness! How is that so? Due to the coming together of the Four Great Elements, there is what is provisionally called a ‘body’. The Four Great Elements are without a master, and the body is also without a self. And so this illness arises entirely from attachment to self. For this reason, one should not give rise to attachment to self.’”

“Thereby understanding the origin of illness, they then cease perception of a self and the perception of sentient beings. One should give rise to the perception of dharmas and they should think, ‘It is only through the gathering of dharmas that this body is produced. Its arising is only the arising of dharmas. Its ceasing is only the cessation of dharmas. Also, these dharmas, each is unknown to the other. When they arise, they do not say, “I have arisen.” When the cease they do not say, “I cease.””

“These bodhisattvas who are ill consider the perception of the cessation of dharmas and they should think, ‘This perception of dharmas, this is also inverted thinking, and inverted thinking is a great calamity that I ought to transcend.’ How is it transcended? By transcending ‘I’ and ‘mine’. How are ‘I’ and ‘mine’ transcended? By transcending duality. How is duality transcended? By being without mindfulness of interiority or exteriority, regarding all dharmas with equanimity. What is equanimity? It is the equality of self and Nirvana. How is that so? The self and Nirvana, these [’this duo’] are empty. Because they are merely names, they are empty. Like this, duality [or, ‘these two dharmas’] is without any certain, fixed nature, and this attainment is equanimity, without any remaining illness, there being only the illness of emptiness, and the illness of emptiness is empty.”

“These bodhisattvas who are ill, by there being nothing to experience, experience all experiences, and while not yet complete in Buddha Dharma, acquire realization without the cessation of experience.”
>>> 「設身有苦，念惡趣眾生，起大悲心，我既調伏，亦當調伏一切眾生；但除其病，而不除法，為斷病本而教導之。何謂病本？謂有攀緣，從有攀緣，則為病本。何所攀緣？謂之三界。云何斷攀緣？以無所得，若無所得，則無攀緣。何謂無所得？謂離二見。何謂二見？謂內見外見，是無所得。文殊師利！是為有疾菩薩調伏其心，為斷老病死苦，是菩薩菩提。若不如是，己所修治，為無慧利。譬如勝怨，乃可為勇。如是兼除老病死者，菩薩之謂也。
<<< “Suppose the body has suffering. Be mindful of sentient beings born in evil realms and give rise to a greatly compassionate mind, [thinking] ‘I have controlled [tamed, disciplined, subdued, tempered] the mind, I should also tame all sentient beings’, by just eliminating the illness, but not eliminating any thing (dharma), teaching and guiding how to cut off the root of illness. What is the root of illness? It is troublesome entanglements. The root of illness is from there being troublesome entanglements. What is that which is entangled? That which is of the Triple World. How are troublesome entanglements cut off? By there being nothing to attain. If there is nothing to attain, then there are no troublesome entanglements. Why is it said there is nothing to attain? It is beyond dualistic views. What is called a dualist view? It is the view from within and the view of outside - these are without attainment.”

“Mañjuśrī! This is how these bodhisattvas who are ill control their minds, how they cut off old age, illness, death, and suffering. This is bodhisattva bodhi. If it is not like this, then that which has been practiced will have been without wisdom or benefit. Just like one who is victorious over their enemy may be considered a hero. Like this, a bodhisattva is so called for being one who eliminates old-age, illness, and death.”
>>> 「彼有疾菩薩應復作是念：『如我此病，非真非有，眾生病亦非真非有。』作是觀時，於諸眾生若起愛見大悲，即應捨離。所以者何？菩薩斷除客塵煩惱而起大悲。愛見悲者，則於生死有疲厭心。若能離此，無有疲厭，在在所生，不為愛見之所覆也。所生無縛，能為眾生說法解縛，如佛所說：『若自有縛，能解彼縛，無有是處！若自無縛，能解彼縛，斯有是處。』是故菩薩不應起縛。何謂縛？何謂解？貪著禪味，是菩薩縛；以方便生，是菩薩解。又無方便慧縛，有方便慧解；無慧方便縛，有慧方便解。何謂無方便慧縛？謂菩薩以愛見心莊嚴佛土、成就眾生；於空、無相、無作法中，而自調伏，是名無方便慧縛。何謂有方便慧解？謂不以愛見心莊嚴佛土、成就眾生，於空、無相、無作法中，以自調伏，而不疲厭，是名有方便慧解。何謂無慧方便縛？謂菩薩住貪欲、瞋恚、邪見等諸煩惱，而植眾德本，是名無慧方便縛。何謂有慧方便解？謂離諸貪欲、瞋恚、邪見等諸煩惱，而植眾德本；迴向阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，是名有慧方便解。文殊師利！彼有疾菩薩，應如是觀諸法，又復觀身無常、苦、空、非我，是名為慧；雖身有疾，常在生死，饒益一切，而不厭倦，是名方便。又復觀身，身不離病，病不離身，是病是身，非新非故，是名為慧；設身有疾，而不永滅，是名方便。
<<< “Those bodhisattvas who are ill should also think, ‘Just as my illness is neither real nor existent, the illness of sentient beings is neither real nor existent.’ When making this observation, if there should arise an affectionate view of great compassion for all sentient beings, then this too should be relinquished. Why? Bodhisattvas remove completely defiling dust and afflictions (āgantu-kleśa), and then give rise to great compassion. One who is compassionate from an affectionate view will then have a mind of aversion toward birth & death (saṃsāra). If one is able to transcend that, they will be without aversion. And wherever they ‘are (re)born’ [happen to find themselves], they wont be blinded by affectionate views. Being born without bonds, they are able to explain to sentient beings the liberation of the Dharma. As the Buddha said, ‘If one is bound themselves, there is no way they would be able to free another! If one is without bonds, there is certainly a way they would be able to free another.’ For this reason, bodhisattvas should not give rise to bonds. What are bonds? What is freedom? A desirous attachment to the taste of dhyana meditation, that is the bond of bodhisattvas. Being born of skillful means is the freedom of bodhisattvas.”

”Further, to be without skillful means is to have bound wisdom, while to have skillful means is to have liberated wisdom. To be without wisdom is to have bound skillful means, while to have wisdom is to have liberated skillful means. What is it to be without skillful means and to have wisdom in bondage? It is for bodhisattvas to use affection to adorn buddha lands and fulfill sentient beings, to control oneself within emptiness, characteristiclessness, and wishlessness. This is called being without skillful means and having wisdom in bondage. What is it to have skillful means with liberated wisdom? It is not to use affection to adorn buddha lands and fulfill sentient beings, and to control oneself so as to be without aversion within emptiness, characteristiclessness, and wishlessness. This is called having skillful means with liberated wisdom.”

“What is it to be without wisdom and to have bound skillful means? It is for bodhisattvas to plant a host of virtuous roots while abiding in the afflictions of desire, anger, and false views. This is called being without wisdom with skillful means in bondage. What is it to have wisdom with liberated skillful means? It is to transcend the afflictions of desire, anger, and false views and plant a host of virtuous roots, transferring (pariṇāmanā) it to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. This is called having wisdom with liberated skillful means.”

“Mañjuśrī! Bodhisattvas *who are ill should observe *dharmas like this. Also, to observe the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and no-self is called wisdom. Though the body is ill, it always exists in birth & death. To benefit all without tiring, this is called skillful means. Also, to observe the body, [one should realize] that the body does not transcend illness and illness does not transcend the body, and that this illness and this body are neither new nor old, this is called wisdom. For one’s body to be ill but to never cease is called skillful means.”
>>> 「文殊師利！有疾菩薩應如是調伏其心，不住其中，亦復不住不調伏心。所以者何？若住不調伏心，是愚人法；若住調伏心，是聲聞法。是故菩薩不當住於調伏、不調伏心，離此二法，是菩薩行。在於生死，不為污行；住於涅槃，不永滅度，是菩薩行；非凡夫行，非賢聖行，是菩薩行；非垢行，非淨行，是菩薩行；雖過魔行，而現降眾魔，是菩薩行；求一切智，無非時求，是菩薩行；雖觀諸法不生，而不入正位，是菩薩行；雖觀十二緣起，而入諸邪見，是菩薩行；雖攝一切眾生，而不愛著，是菩薩行；雖樂遠離，而不依身心盡，是菩薩行；雖行三界，而不壞法性，是菩薩行；雖行於空，而植眾德本，是菩薩行；雖行無相，而度眾生，是菩薩行；雖行無作，而現受身，是菩薩行；雖行無起，而起一切善行，是菩薩行；雖行六波羅蜜，而遍知眾生心、心數法，是菩薩行；雖行六通，而不盡漏，是菩薩行；雖行四無量心，而不貪著生於梵世，是菩薩行；雖行禪定解脫三昧，而不隨禪生，是菩薩行；雖行四念處，而不永離身受心法，是菩薩行；雖行四正勤，而不捨身心精進，是菩薩行；雖行四如意足，而得自在神通，是菩薩行；雖行五根，而分別眾生諸根利鈍，是菩薩行；雖行五力，而樂求佛十力，是菩薩行；雖行七覺分，而分別佛之智慧，是菩薩行；雖行八聖道，而樂行無量佛道，是菩薩行；雖行止觀助道之法，而不畢竟墮於寂滅，是菩薩行；雖行諸法不生不滅，而以相好莊嚴其身，是菩薩行；雖現聲聞、辟支佛威儀，而不捨佛法，是菩薩行；雖隨諸法究竟淨相，而隨所應為現其身，是菩薩行；雖觀諸佛國土永寂如空，而現種種清淨佛土，是菩薩行；雖得佛道轉于法輪，入於涅槃，而不捨於菩薩之道，是菩薩行。」
<<< “Mañjuśrī! Bodhisattvas who are ill should control their minds like this, not abiding within [a controlled mind], and also not abiding without a controlled mind. How is that so? If they were to abide in [or with] an undisciplined mind, this is the method (dharma) of fools. If they abide with a controlled mind, this is the method of Voice Hearers. For this reason, bodhisattvas shouldn’t abide in a controlled mind or an uncontrolled mind. Transcending this duality (this duo, these two dharmas), this is the practice of bodhisattvas. To be within birth & death without polluting practices, to abide in Nirvana without ever completely ceasing, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Neither a common practice nor the practice of sages, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Neither defiled practice nor pure practice, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though they perform practices of Mara, they then subjugate the hordes of Mara, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Seeking omniscience, but not seeking at the wrong time, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though observing that all dharmas are birthless, they do not enter the absolute, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though observing the 12 links of the chain of origination arise, they enter all erroneous views, this is the practice of bodhisattvas.

Though practicing within emptiness, they plant hosts of virtuous roots, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing with characteristiclessness, they rescue sentient beings, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing within wishlessness, they appear to ‘receive’ a body, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. *Though practicing without arising, they give rise to all virtuous practices, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. *Though practicing the six paramitas (transcendences), they transcend the minds and inclinations of all sentient beings, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the six penetrations, they do not cease outflows, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the four immeasurable states of mind, they do not desire being reborn in the Brahmaviharas, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing dhyāna, vimokṣa, and samādhi, they are not reborn in accord with dhyāna, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, they never transcend body, sensations, mind-states, and dharmas, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the four right efforts, they never relinquish determination (vīrya) of body and mind, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. *Though practicing the four steps towards supernatural power (ṛddhipāda), they have attained sovereign spiritual power, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the five faculties, they differentiate the sharp and dull faculties of all sentient beings, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the five powers, they delight in seeking the ten powers of a buddha, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the seven aids to awakening, they differentiate the wisdom of the buddhas, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the noble eightfold path, they delight in practicing the immeasurable path of the buddha, this is the practice of bodhisattvas.

<<< Maitreya replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was explaining practices related to the stage [bhumi] of nonregression to the King of the Tushita Heaven and his retinue. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Maitreya! The World-Honored One bestowed upon you, Venerable], the prophecy - one more birth and you will attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Which birth received this prophecy? Was it the past? The future? The present? If it was a past life [’birth’], that past life is extinguished; if it was in a future life, that future life has yet to arrive; if it was this present life, the present life does not remain [abide]. As the Buddha has said, “Bhikṣus! You are now, in this present moment, born, get old, and are extinguished.’”
>>> “’If it was by way of birthlessness that you attained this prophecy, birthlessness is the correct status, and within the correct status there is no receiving prophecies and there is no attainment of *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi,* and what ‘Maitreya’ could receive a prophecy about one more birth?’”

“’Was it from the arising [birth] of Suchness [tathatā] that you attained reception of this prophecy? Was it from the cessation of Suchness that you attain reception of this prophecy? If it was from the arising of Suchness, Suchness is without arising. If it was from the cessation of Suchness, Suchness is without any cessation. All sentient beings are entirely such, all dharmas are also such, the gathered sages and wise ones are such, even Maitreya is such. If Maitreya received this prophecy, all sentient beings should then also receive it. Why? Suchness is nondual and undifferentiated. If Maitreya attains anuttara-samyak-sambodhi**,* then all sentient beings should attain it. Why? All sentient beings are characteristics of *bodhi* [awakening]. If Maitreya attains cessation [*nirodha*], then all sentient beings should attain cessation. Why? All buddhas know each sentient being is ultimately extinguished [ceased], which is the characteristic of *nirvāṇa*, and cannot again be further extinguished. For this reason, Maitreya! Inspire all these gods without using this teaching [*dharma*], for really there is no generating ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta, and no one not regressing.’”

“’Maitreya! You should have these gods relinquish a discriminatory view of bodhi [awakening]. Why? Bodhi cannot be attained by the body, and it cannot be attained by the mind. Ultimate extinguishment is bodhi since all characteristics are extinguished. Not observing is bodhi, since it is beyond all conditions. Not practicing is bodhi, since it is without conceptualization. Severance [cutting off, detachment] is bodhi, since all views are relinquished. Departure [leaving, transcendence, being free from] is bodhi, since it is free from [transcends] all erroneous thinking. Hindrances are bodhi, since all vows are hindered. Not entering is bodhi, since it is without desirous attachments. Being in accord is bodhi for being in accord with Suchness. Abiding is bodhi due to the abiding nature of all things [dharmas]. Arrival is bodhi for it arrives at the Limit of Reality. Non-duality is bodhi, being free from mind and thoughts [dharmas]. Equanimity is bodhi, being equal to empty space. The unconditioned is bodhi because there is no arising, abiding, or ceasing. Knowledge is bodhi because of the practice of understanding the minds of all sentient beings. Non-Association is bodhi because no association is entered. Not joining is bodhi because it is free of all afflictions. Non-locatedness is bodhi because it has no shape or form.

He replied to me saying, ‘I am coming from the Site of Enlightenment [Bodhimaṇḍala, circle, or place of awakening; where Buddha attained enlightenment. Japanese Dojo - ‘Area of the Way’].’

I replied, ‘What is the Site of Enlightenment?’

He replied, ‘An upright mind is the Site of Enlightenment, for it is without being ‘baseless’ [unfounded] or false. Generating practice is the Site of Enlightenment, for it can attend to things. A profound [’deep’] mind is the Site of Enlightenment, for it increases benefits. The awakened mind [Bodhicitta] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it is without error or exaggeration. Generosity [dana], is the Site of Enlightenment, because it seeks no reward. Upholding the precepts [sila] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it fulfills vows. Patience tolerance [ksanti] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it enables one to view all sentient beings with a mind free of obstruction. Determination [vīrya] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it forestalls laziness and regression. Meditation [dhyāna] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it makes the mind tame and gentle. Wisdom [prajñā] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it sees all things as they are. Loving-kindness [maitrī] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it views all living beings equally. Compassion [karuṇā] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it bears up under weariness and pain. Joy [muditā] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it revels in Dharma delight. Equanimity [upekṣā] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it rejects both hatred and desire. Transcendental powers [ṛddhi] are the Site of Enlightenment, because thereby one masters the six powers. Liberation [vimokṣa] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it knows how to renounce and set aside. Expedient means [upāya] are the Site of Enlightenment, because they can teach and convert living beings. The four means of unification (saṃgraha: generosity, kind speech, volunteerism, and cooperation) are the Site of Enlightenment, because they can unify living beings. Much learning [bāhuśrutya] is the Site of Enlightenment, because one carries out what one has learned. A disciplined mind [nāśayet-citta?] is the Site of Enlightenment, because one can thereby contemplate all phenomena correctly. The thirty-seven aids to the Way [saptatriṃśad bodhi-pākṣika-dharmāḥ] are the Site of Enlightenment, because through them one rejects what is conditioned. Truth [satya] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it does not deceive the world. Conditionality [pratītya-samutpāda] is the Site of Enlightenment, for none of the [12] links in the chain of causation, from ignorance to old age and death, ever come to an end. Earthly desires [sarva-kleśa] are the Site of Enlightenment, for through them we know the nature of Suchness. *Living beings [sattva] are the Site of Enlightenment, for through them we know that there is no self. All phenomena [sarva-dharma] are the Site of Enlightenment, for through them we know the emptiness of all phenomena. Conquering Mara [māra-dhvaṃsana] is the Site of Enlightenment, because one is unswayed, unflinching. The threefold world [tridhatu] is the Site of Enlightenment, because there is no path for one there. The lion's roar [siṃha-nāda] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it has nothing it fears. The ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the eighteen unshared properties are the Site of Enlightenment, because they are free of all fault. The three insights [trividyā] are the Site of Enlightnment, because they are without the least obstruction. Understanding all dharmas in a single instant of thought is the Site of Enlightenment, because one thereby becomes master of all wisdom. Thus, good sir, if bodhisattvas apply themselves to the *pāramitās and teach and convert living beings, then you should understand that everything they do, every lifting of a foot, every placing of a foot, will in effect be ‘coming from the Site of Enlightenment," abiding in Buddha Dharma.’”

Accompanied by his retinue, they bowed their heads at my feet, pressed their palms together, and stood to one side. I thought it was Indra, and I said to him, 'Welcome, Kaushika! Though you enjoy good fortune, you should never be self-indulgent. You should contemplate the impermanence of the five senses and strive thereby to plant good roots. With body, life, and resources you should cultivate the steadfast Dharma.’”

“But then Indra said to me, 'Noble sir, please accept these twelve thousand goddesses. They can serve and wash you.'”

"Marā was alarmed and fearful, thinking that Vimalakirti was perhaps going to make trouble for him. He tried to hide himself and escape, but he could not make himself invisible. Though he exhausted all his supernatural powers, he could not get away.”

He further said, 'Now that you have generated a Mind of the Way, you may regale yourselves with Dharma joy and need no longer delight in the pleasures of the five senses.’”

“The goddesses replied, ‘What is this you call Dharma joy?'”

"Vimalakirti replied, 'To delight in constant faith in the Buddha, to delight in the desire to hear the Dharma, to delight in giving alms to the sangha, to delight in casting off the five senses, to delight in observing the five aggregates as vengeful bandits, to delight in observing the four great elements as poiso­nous snakes, to delight in observing the mind and the senses as an empty village, to delight in following and guarding a Mind of the Way, to delight in benefiting living beings, to delight in hon­oring and supporting teachers, to delight in practicing wide spread generosity, to delight in the observance of the precepts, to delight in patience, humility, gentleness, and harmony, to delight in diligently amassing good roots, to delight in medita­tion that is never disordered, to delight in bright, undefiled wis­dom, to delight in broadening the mind that aspires to bodhi, to delight in conquering and subduing Marā, to delight in cutting off all afflictions, to delight in purifying Buddha lands, to delight in gaining merit so that one may in time succeed in acquiring auspicious characteristics, to delight in adorning the ‘site of enlightenment’, to delight in listening fearlessly to profound Dharma, to delight in the three gates to liberation and not to delight in untimely teachings, to delight in being friendly with those of like learning, to delight in a mind free of anger and hostility when among those of unlike learn­ing, to delight in guiding and protecting friends that you know who are evil, to delight in being friendly with good friends, to delight in a mind that finds joy in purity, to delight in practicing the Dharma regard­ing the immeasurable elements of the Way — these make up the Dharma joy of a bodhisattva.'”
>>> 「於是波旬告諸女言：『我欲與汝俱還天宮。』諸女言：『以我等與此居士，有法樂，我等甚樂，不復樂五欲樂也。』魔言：『居士可捨此女？一切所有施於彼者，是為菩薩。』維摩詰言：『我已捨矣！汝便將去，令一切眾生得法願具足。』於是諸女問維摩詰：『我等云何，止於魔宮？』維摩詰言：『諸姊！有法門名無盡燈，汝等當學。無盡燈者，譬如一燈，燃百千燈，冥者皆明，明終不盡。如是，諸姊！夫一菩薩開導百千眾生，令發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，於其道意亦不滅盡，隨所說法，而自增益一切善法，是名無盡燈也。汝等雖住魔宮，以是無盡燈，令無數天子天女，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心者，為報佛恩，亦大饒益一切眾生。』爾時天女頭面禮維摩詰足，隨魔還宮，忽然不現。世尊！維摩詰有如是自在神力，智慧辯才，故我不任詣彼問疾。」

“Marā said, ‘Layman, are you able to relinquish these women? The one who gives away everything they have, this is a bodhisattva.’”

“Vimalakirti replied, ‘I have already relinquished them! You can leave, but you must fulfill all sentient beings wish for the Dharma.’”

“At this, all the women asked Vimalakirti, ‘How can we stay in Marā’s palace?’”

“Vimalakirti replied, ‘Sisters! There is a Dharma Door called the Inexhaustible Lamp, which you should study. The inexhaustible lamp is like one lamp that ignites a hundred thousand lamps, illuminating all darkness with an illumination that is never exhausted. Like this, sisters! One bodhisattva opens and guides a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta, the mind set on the Way will also never be extinguished or exhausted, and by following the Dharma as it has been explained, one increases their offering of all virtuous Dharmas - this is called the Inexhaustible Lamp. Although you reside in Marā’s palace, with this Inexhaustible Lamp you can enable countless gods and goddesses to generate anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta. Thus you will repay the Buddha’s kindness and also greatly benefit sentient beings.’”

"At that time the goddesses bowed their heads at Vimalakirti's feet and then accompanied Marā back to his palace, suddenly disappearing from sight. World-Honored One! Vimalakirti possesses such sovereign command of supernatural powers like this, knowledge, wisdom and eloquence, and for this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

<<< Sudatta replied to the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was holding a great ‘giving gathering’ in my father’s house. We made offerings to all the śramaṇas, brahmans, those of the heterodox paths, the poor, low-class, orphans, and beggars. After a full seven days, Vimalakīrti entered the gathering and said to me, ‘Elder’s son! You should not hold a great giving gathering like this. You should have a gathering for giving the Dharma. What use is a gathering to give material wealth?’”

“I said, ‘Sir! What does a gathering for giving Dharma mean?’”

“He answered, ‘A gathering for giving Dharma has no before or after. In a single thought-moment, offerings are made to all sentient beings. This is called gathering for giving Dharma.’”

“I replied, ‘What does that mean?’”

“He said, ‘It means: by way of bodhi (awakening) one gives rise to a mind of loving-kindness, by aiding living beings one gives rise to a mind of great compassion, by adhering to the correct Dharma one cultivates a joyful mind, and by embracing wisdom one practices with an equanimous mind. By embracing grudging and greed one gives rise to dāna-pāramitā. By ‘converting’ (transforming) those who break the rules one gives rise to śīla-pāramitā. By way of the Dharma of ‘no-self’ one gives rise to kṣānti-pāramitā. By transcending the characteristics of body and mind one gives rise to vīrya-pāramitā. By the characteristic of bodhi (awakening) one gives rise to dhyāna-pāramitā. And by omniscience one gives rise to prajñā-pāramitā.’”
>>> ‘”[It means:] Teaching and transforming sentient beings, yet giving rise to emptiness. Not relinquishing conditioned dharmas, yet giving rise to characteristiclessness. Having the appearance of taking birth, yet giving rise to wishlessness.’”

“’Guarding the correct Dharma, one gives rise to the power of expedient means. By rescuing sentient beings one gives rise to the Four Means of Unification. By revering everything, one gives rise to the elimination of conceit. Through body, life, and wealth [the ‘three unstable thing’] one gives rise to the three stable things. Being within the six mindfulnesses one gives rise to contemplation of the dharma. Through the six types of considerate esteem (saṃrañjanīyadharma: metta in body, speech, and mind, sharing, morality, and correct view) one generates sincerity. Correctly practicing the subtle dharma, one gives rise to pure livelihood. With a mind pure and joyful, one ‘rises’ nearer to the wise and sagely. Not having aversion for bad people, one generates a disciplined mind. By the dharma of leaving home, one gives rise to a profound mind. *By practicing according to the explanation, one generates erudition. By the dharma of non-contention, one gives rise to the place of solitary practice [araṇya*]. Approaching the Wisdom of the Buddha, one gives rise to a meditative posture. Releasing the bonds of sentient beings, one gives rise to the cultivation of the stages. By being gloriously adorned with auspicious characteristics and purifying a buddha land, one gives rise to meritorious karma. Understanding the thoughts of all sentient beings and how one should explain the Dharma to them, one gives rise to the karma of knowledge. Understanding all the dharmas, neither grasping nor relinquishing, entering the gateway of the Single Characteristic, one gives rise to the karma of wisdom. Cutting off all the afflictions, all the hindrances, and all the unvirtuous dharmas, one gives rise to all virtuous karma. By attaining all-knowing wisdom, all virtuous dharmas, one gives rise to all the dharmas that assist one’s Way to Buddhahood [i.e. ’the 37 aids to awakening’].’

“’Thus, virtuous man! This is a gathering for giving Dharma. If a bodhisattva abides in this gathering for giving Dharma they will be a great donor and a field of blessings for the entire world.’”

世尊！維摩詰說是法時，婆羅門眾中二百人，皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。我時心得清淨，歎未曾有！稽首禮維摩詰足，即解瓔珞價直百千以上之，不肯取。我言：『居士！願必納受，隨意所與。』維摩詰乃受瓔珞，分作二分，持一分施此會中一最下乞人，持一分奉彼難勝如來。一切眾會皆見光明國土難勝如來，又見珠瓔在彼佛上變成四柱寶臺，四面嚴飾，不相障蔽。時維摩詰現神變已，作是言：『若施主等心施一最下乞人，猶如如來福田之相，無所分別，等于大悲，不求果報，是則名曰具足法施。』城中一最下乞人，見是神力，聞其所說，皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，故我不任詣彼問疾。」
<<< “World-honored One! When Vimalakīrti explained this Dharma, two hundred people among the assembly of brahmans all generated anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta. At that moment, my own mind attained a level of purity I had never had. I bowed my head to Vimalakīrti’s feet in reverence and unfastened my necklace (mālā), a hundred thousand in value, to give to him, but he would not accept it. I said, ‘Please, sir, you must accept this and give it to whomever you please.’”

“Vimalakīrti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. Taking one part, he gave it to the lowliest beggars in the assembly. Taking the other part, he offered it to Sudurjayā Tathāgata (’Difficult to Conquer’ Thus Come One). The entire assembly then saw the land Radiant Illumination and the Tathāgata Sudurjayā . They also saw a pearl necklace on that Buddha change into a four tier jewel-laden platform, with ornamentation of mutually noninterfering characteristics on all four sides.”

“Having manifested these spiritual transformations, Vimalakīrti then said, ‘If a donor gives to the lowliest of beggars with an equanimous mind [heart], just as if they were giving to the Tathāgata’s field of blessings, with no distinction, with great compassion without seeking any reward, this is called “being completed (accomplished) in the Dharma of Giving.”’

“The lowliest beggars in the city, seeing this spiritual power and hearing this explanation, all generated anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

Being within their equality, without duality, is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 喜見菩薩曰：「色、色空為二。色即是空，非色滅空，色性自空。如是受、想、行、識、識空為二，識即是空，非識滅空，識性自空，於其中而通達者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Joyful Sight Bodhisattva (Priyadarśana) said, “Form and the emptiness of form make a duality. Form is just empty. Not by the emptiness of the cessation (or destruction) of form, form is empty by its very nature. Like this, sensation, perception, conditioning, consciousness, and the emptiness of consciousness make dualities. Consciousness is just empty. Not by the emptiness of the cessation of consciousness, consciousness is empty by its very nature. Penetrating the middle of these is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 明相菩薩曰：「四種異、空種異為二。四種性即是空種性，如前際、後際空，故中際亦空。若能如是知諸種性者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Sign of Illumination Bodhisattva (Prābhaketu) said “Differentiating the Four Elements and differentiating them from the element Space make dualities. The nature of the Four Elements is the nature of the element Space; empty, like the future and past, the in between (i.e. present) is also empty. To know the nature of all elements like this is to enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 妙意菩薩曰：「眼、色為二。若知眼性，於色不貪、不恚、不癡，是名寂滅。如是耳聲、鼻香、舌味、身觸、意法為二，若知意性，於法不貪、不恚、不癡，是名寂滅，安住其中，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Wonderful Mind Bodhisattva (Pramati) said, “The Eye and form make dualities. If one knows the nature of the eye, not being desirous, averse, or confused about form, this is called tranquil cessation. Like this, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and flavors, the body and feelings, the mind and ideas (dharmas), make dualities. Knowing the nature of the mind, not desirous of, averse to, or confused about ideas is called tranquil cessation, which peacefully abiding within is called entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 無盡意菩薩曰：「布施、迴向一切智為二。布施性即是迴向一切智性，如是持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定、智慧、迴向一切智為二，智慧性即是迴向一切智性，於其中入一相者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Inexhaustible Mind Bodhisattva (Akṣayamati) said, “Dāna (giving) and the transference to omniscience (sarvajñānapariṇāmanā) make a duality. The nature of dāna is the transference to omniscience. Like this, śīla, kṣānti, virya, dhyāna, prajñā, and the transference to omniscience make dualities. The nature of prajñā is the nature of the transference to omniscience, and to enter the singleness of these is to enter the Dharma Door on Nonduality.” * 
>>> 深慧菩薩曰：「是空、是無相、是無作為二。空即無相，無相即無作；若空、無相、無作，則無心意識。於一解脫門即是三解脫門者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Profound Wisdom Bodhisattva (Gambhinīrmati) said, “Emptiness (śūnyatā), characteristiclessness (ānamitta), and desirelessness (apraṇihita) make dualities. Emptiness is without characteristics and that which is without characteristics is undesirable. If empty, characteristicless, and desireless, then there is no mind (citta), thought (mānas) or consciousness (vijñāna). That the three doors of liberation are a single door of liberation is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

<<< Tranquil Roots Bodhisattva (Śāntendriya) said, “Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha make dualities. The Buddha is the Dharma, and the Dharma is the Sangha. These three jewels are without the characteristic of being conditioned, as equal as space, as are all dharmas. Being able to follow this practice is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

One who sees the Real Nature of the body, not giving rise to seeing a body or seeing the extinction of the body. The body and the extinction of the body not as two, without differentiation. Being unalarmed in between them, being unafraid is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 上善菩薩曰：「身、口、意善為二。是三業皆無作相，身無作相，即口無作相；口無作相，即意無作相；是三業無作相，即一切法無作相。能如是隨無作慧者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Superior Virtue Bodhisattva (Suvinīta) said, “Virtues of body, speech, and mind make dualities. These three karmic actions are without the characteristic of being enacted (anabhisaṃskāra-lakṣana). The body is without the characteristic of being enacted, so the mouth is without the characteristic of being enacted. As the mouth is without the characteristic of being enacted, so the mind is without the characteristic of being enacted. These three karmic actions being without the characteristic of being enacted, then dharmas are without the characteristic of being enacted. Being able to follow unenacted wisdom like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 福田菩薩曰：「福行、罪行、不動行為二。三行實性即是空，空則無福行、無罪行、無不動行。於此三行而不起者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Field of Merit Bodhisattva (Puṇyakṣetra) said, “Meritorious acts, transgressive acts, and unmoving acts make dualities. The Real Nature of these three acts is emptiness, and emptiness is without meritorious action, without transgressive action, and without unmoving actions. Being in the non-arising of these three actions is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 華嚴菩薩曰：「從我起二為二。見我實相者，不起二法；若不住二法，則無有識。無所識者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Flower Arrangement Bodhisattva (Padmavyūha) said, “The arising of two (duality) from self makes a duality. One who sees the Real Characteristic of the self does not give rise to there being two things (dharmas). If there is no abiding in two things, then there is no consciousness [of anything]. Being without there being consciousness is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 德藏菩薩曰：「有所得相為二。若無所得，則無取捨。無取捨者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Treasury of Virtue Bodhisattva (Śrīgarbha) said, “The characteristic that there is something to attain something makes a duality. If there is nothing to attain, then there is nothing to grasp or let go of. Being without grasping and letting go is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality,”
>>> 月上菩薩曰：「闇與明為二。無闇、無明，則無有二。所以者何？如入滅受想定，無闇、無明，一切法相亦復如是，於其中平等入者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Moon in Midair Bodhisattva (Candrottara) said, “Darkness along with illumination make a duality. Being without darkness and without illumination, then there are not two. How so? Like entering a meditation where there is the cessation of sensation and perception (nirodhasamāpatti), which is without darkness and without illumination, the characteristics of all dharmas are also like this. Entering the equality (samatā) of these is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 寶印手菩薩曰：「樂涅槃、不樂世間為二。若不樂涅槃、不厭世間，則無有二。所以者何？若有縛，則有解。若本無縛，其誰求解？無縛無解，則無樂厭，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Jewel Mudra Hand Bodhisattva (Ratnamudrāhasta) said, “To delight in Nirvana and not delight in the world make a duality. If one does not delight in Nirvana and does not have disgust for the world, then there are not two. How so? If there is bondage, then there is liberation. If originally there is no bondage, then who is there to seek liberation? Being without bondage and without liberation, thus without delight or disgust, is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 珠頂王菩薩曰：「正道、邪道為二。住正道者，則不分別是邪是正，離此二者，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Jewel Crown King Bodhisattva (Mānikuṭārāja) said, “The Right Way and the wrong way make a duality. One who abides in the Right Way does not differentiate between what is wrong and right. Transcending these two is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 樂實菩薩曰：「實、不實為二。實見者尚不見實，何況非實！所以者何？非肉眼所見，慧眼乃能見，而此慧眼，無見無不見，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Delight in Reality Bodhisattva (Satyarata) said, “Real (satya) and not real make a duality. One who really sees does not even see what is reality, how much more so what is not reality? How so? The Eye of Wisdom sees what the eye of flesh cannot, and this Eye of Wisdom that is without seeing and without not seeing is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 如是諸菩薩各各說已，問文殊師利：「何等是菩薩入不二法門？」
<<< When all the bodhisattvas had each explained like this they asked Mañjuśrī, “How does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality?”
>>> 文殊師利曰：「如我意者，於一切法無言無說，無示無識，離諸問答，是為入不二法門。」
<<< Mañjuśrī said, “As I understand it, being without words and without explanation, without indication and without consciousness, transcending all questions and answers is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 於是文殊師利問維摩詰：「我等各自說已，仁者當說何等是菩薩入不二法門？」
<<< At this, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “We have each now explained. Will the venerable now explain how this bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality?” 
>>> 時維摩詰默然無言。
<<< Vimalakīrti was silent, remaining speechless.
>>> 文殊師利歎曰：「善哉！善哉！乃至無有文字、語言，是真入不二法門。」
<<< Mañjuśrī sighed and said, “Excellent! Excellent! Not even a word, not a syllable is truly entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”
>>> 說是入不二法門品時，於此眾中，五千菩薩皆入不二法門，得無生法忍。
<<< When this chapter on entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality was explained, five thousand bodhisattvas among those assembled all entered the Dharma Door of Nonduality and attained the patient tolerance of the non-arising of dharmas.

<<< Once, the Buddha was in the Amra Gardens in the city of Vaiśālī, accompanied by a great assembly of leading monks numbering eight thousand. There were also thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, all known to the assembly, persons who had car­ried out all the basic practices of great wisdom. Sustained by the might and supernatural power of the Buddhas, they accepted and upheld the correct Dharma in order to guard the citadel of the Dharma. They knew how to roar the lion's roar, and their names were heard throughout the Ten Directions. Without waiting to be asked, they befriended others and brought them comfort. They ensured the continuance and prosperity of the Three Treasures, making certain that these never expired. They conquered and subdued the ill will of Mara, and corrected erroneous ways, being already totally purified, having long ago rid themselves of bondage. Their minds constantly resided in a state of unhindered liberation [apratihata-vimokṣa]. Their mindfulness, medita­tion, retention, and eloquence were unbroken. Their Generosity, Discipline, Patience, Determination, Dhyana, Wisdom, and the power of Upaya (skillful means), none were not complete. Coming to the patience (kshanti) that there is nothing to be attained and that nothing (no dharma) arises, they were able to respond compliantly to others and to turn the non-regressing Wheel of the Dharma. Well comprehending the charac­teristics of all things (dharmas), they understand the capacities (faculties) of liv­ing beings. Towering over the others in the great assembly, by cultivating their minds they were without fear of anything, meritorious and wise. Their bodies were adorned with auspicious characteristics, their form and images foremost [#1, the best, perfect], having let go of all worldly embellishments [adornments and auspices]. Their fame and renown were as high and broad as Mt. Sumeru. Their profound faith was as firm as Vajra. The jewels of their Dharma shone everywhere, raining down the sweet dew. Among the assembly, the sound of their words was the most subtle and wonderful of all. They had plumbed the depths of Dependent Origination and cut off all erroneous views, no longer entertaining the concepts of either being or nonbeing. They explained the all encompassing Dharma fearlessly, as roaring lions, their explaining rolling forth like thunder, without measure, beyond measurement. In gathering Dharma jewels, they were like practiced pilots at sea, having all the pro­found and subtle meanings of the Dharma. They were excellent in perceiving the past and future existences of living beings and the habits (samskara, ‘workings’) of their minds. They came close to equaling the sovereign (independent, isvara) wisdom of the Buddha, the ten powers, the [four] fearless­nesses, and the eighteen unique dharmas. Though they had firmly closed the gate to all manner of evil existences, yet they allowed themselves to be born in the five lower realms, manifesting themselves there so that they might act as great physi­cian kings, adroitly healing the ills of others, giving what­ever medicine suited to the ailment, and insuring that the patient takes it as prescribed. Immeasurable merit — all they had acquired; Immeasurable Buddha lands — all they had made marvelously pure. No one saw or listened to them without profiting thereby, and no action of theirs was ever performed in vain. Such was the man­ner in which all merit adhered to them.

<<< There were also ten thousand Brahma kings, Shikhin and others, who had come from the other four-continent worlds to visit the place where the Buddha was and listen to the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand Indras who had come from the other four-continent worlds to take a seat in the gathering. In addition, there were other heavenly beings of great authority and power, as well as nagas, spirits, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, mahoragas, and others, all who came to take a seat in the assembly. Also arrived to take seats in the assembly were the various monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.

At that time the Buddha, reverently surrounded by this mul­titude of countless hundreds and thousands of beings, explained the Dharma for them. He was like Mt. Sumeru, king of moun­tains, rising up out of the great sea. Resting at ease on his lion throne seat clustered with jewels, he shed his radiance over all the great throng gathered there.
>>> 爾時毘耶離城有長者子，名曰寶積，與五百長者子，俱持七寶蓋，來詣佛所，頭面禮足，各以其蓋共供養佛。佛之威神，令諸寶蓋合成一蓋，遍覆三千大千世界，而此世界廣長之相，悉於中現；又此三千大千世界諸須彌山、雪山、目真隣陀山、摩訶目真隣陀山、香山、寶山、金山、黑山、鐵圍山、大鐵圍山，大海江河，川流泉源，及日月星辰、天宮、龍宮、諸尊神宮，悉現於寶蓋中；又十方諸佛，諸佛說法，亦現於寶蓋中。爾時一切大眾。覩佛神力，歎未曾有！合掌禮佛，瞻仰尊顏，目不暫捨。於是長者子寶積即於佛前，以偈頌曰：
<<< At that time, the son of a wealthy elder of the city of Vaiśālī named Ratnakūṭa (Jeweled Accumulation), along with five hundred other sons of wealthy elders, came to the place where the Buddha was, all of them bearing parasols adorned with the seven treasures, and bowed their heads in obeisance before the feet of the Buddha, each offering their parasols to the Buddha.

The Buddha with his supernatural powers then caused all the jeweled parasols to come together and form one single parasol that spread over the entire Three Thousand Great Thousand world- system, with all the vast features of those worlds manifest within it. All the Sumeru mountains of the three thousand great thousand world system, Snow Mountains, Muchilinda Mountains, Mahamuchilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jeweled Mountains, Gold Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron Encircling Mountains, Great Iron Encircling Mountains, the huge seas, the rivers and watercourses, brooks and streams, fountains and springs, as well as the suns, moons, stars, constellations, heavenly palaces, dragon palaces, and the palaces of venerable spirits - all these were to be seen within the jeweled parasol. Also, the Buddhas of the ten directions, the Buddhas as they explain the Dharma -  these too were visible within the jeweled parasol.

At that time all the members of the great assembly, witness­ing this manifestation of the Buddha's supernatural power, sighed in admiration at what they had never seen before. Pressing their palms together, they made obeisance to the Buddha, gazing up in reverence at the face of the World-Honored One and never taking their eyes from it.

Then the elder’s son, Ratnakūṭa, in the pres­ence of the Buddha recited these verses of praise:
>>> 目淨脩廣如青蓮，　　
心淨已度諸禪定，　
久積淨業稱無量，　　
導眾以寂故稽首。
<<< Eyes pure and broad like the blue lotus,
Mind pure, free in all Dhyana meditations,

Guiding beings with quietude, therefore we bow our heads.

Every one of these we have seen and heard.

<<< The power of the Dharma King's Dharma surpasses all other beings,
Constantly bestowing Dharma riches on them all.
Skillfully he distinguishes the characteristics of all things (dharmas),
Never faltering in his grasp of the one great Truth.
You have learned to treat all things (dharmas) with sovereignty,
So we bow our heads to this Dharma King.
>>> 說法不有亦不無，　　
以因緣故諸法生，　
無我無造無受者，

<<< You explain things (dharmas) as neither existing nor not existing;

No "I," no doer, no recipient,
Yet good and bad karma never cease to function.

<<< Three times you turned the Wheel of the Dharma in the Great Thousand world-system,
The wheel that from the first has always been pure.
Heavenly and human beings gained the way— this was proof of it;
The Three Treasures thereupon appeared in the world.

<<< This wonderful Dharma brought rescue to many beings;
Embracing it, they never regress but dwell in constant quietude.
Great physician king, healer of old age, sick­ness and death,
We pay homage to the boundless virtues of your Ocean of Dharma;

You have compassion in in equal measure upon the virtuous and the non-virtuous,
Equanimious in mind and action, like empty space,
Who, hearing this jewel of humankind, does not give respect?

Everything that exists in the world we see—

<<< When the elder’s son Ratnakūṭa had fin­ished reciting these verses, he addressed the Buddha, saying, "World-Honored One! These five hundred sons of elders have all set their minds on anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (supreme, unsurpassable enlightenment). They wish to hear how one can purify the Buddha lands. We beg the World-Honored One to explain the practices carried out by bodhisattvas in purifying the lands."
>>> 佛言：「善哉！寶積！乃能為諸菩薩，問於如來淨土之行。諦聽，諦聽！善思念之，當為汝說！」於是寶積及五百長者子受教而聽。
<<< The Buddha said, "Excellent! Jeweled Accumulation! For the sake of the bodhisattvas you do right to ask the Thus Come One about the practices for purifying the lands. Listen well! Listen well! Consider well! I will now explain to you." Ratnakūṭa and the other five hundred sons of elders then made ready to listen to the teachings addressed to them.
>>> 佛言：「寶積！眾生之類是菩薩佛土。所以者何？菩薩隨所化眾生而取佛土，隨所調伏眾生而取佛土，隨諸眾生應以何國入佛智慧而取佛土，隨諸眾生應以何國起菩薩根而取佛土。所以者何？菩薩取於淨國，皆為饒益諸眾生故。譬如有人，欲於空地，造立宮室，隨意無礙；若於虛空，終不能成！菩薩如是，為成就眾生故，願取佛國，願取佛國者，非於空也。
<<< The Buddha said, "Ratnakūṭa! The various kinds of sentient beings are in themselves the Buddha lands of the bodhisattvas. How so? Because it is by transforming various sentient beings to discipline (vinaya) that bodhisattvas acquire Buddha lands. It is by persuading various sentient beings and overcoming their objec­tions that bodhisattvas acquire Buddha lands. It is by inducing the various sentient beings to enter into the Wisdom of the Buddha in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands. It is by inducing the various sentient beings to develop the capacity (faculty, indriya) for bodhisattva practices in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands. How so? Because the bodhisattva's acquisition of a pure land is wholly due to having brought benefit to living beings. Suppose someone proposes to build a mansion on a plot of open land. They may do so as they wish without hindrance. But if one tries to build it in the emptiness of the sky, they will never be successful. It is the same with the bodhisattvas. It is because they wish to help others to achieve success that they take their vow to acquire Buddha lands. Their vow to acquire Buddha lands in not founded on nothing (i.e. not in vein).
>>> 「寶積當知！直心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，不諂眾生來生其國；深心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，具足功德眾生來生其國；菩提心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，大乘眾生來生其國；布施是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，一切能捨眾生來生其國；持戒是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，行十善道滿願眾生來生其國；忍辱是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，三十二相莊嚴眾生來生其國；精進是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，勤修一切功德眾生來生其國；禪定是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，攝心不亂眾生來生其國；智慧是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，正定眾生來生其國；四無量心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，成就慈悲喜捨眾生來生其國；四攝法是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，解脫所攝眾生來生其國；方便是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，於一切法方便無礙眾生來生其國；三十七道品是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，念處、正勤、神足、根、力、覺、道眾生來生其國；迴向心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，得一切具足功德國土；說除八難是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，國土無有三惡八難；自守戒行、不譏彼闕是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，國土無有犯禁之名；十善是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，命不中夭，大富梵行，所言誠諦，常以軟語，眷屬不離，善和諍訟，言必饒益，不嫉不恚，正見眾生來生其國。

The Buddha then released the supernatural power that he had exercised with his [big] toe, and the world returned to its former appearance. Thirty-two thousand heavenly and human beings who wished to pursue the path of śrāvakas, understanding that all things are impermanent in nature, cast off the dust from their eyes, removed themselves from defilement, and attained the pure Dharma Eye; and eight thousand monks, ceasing to accept the phenomenal world, put an end to all outflows and gained liberation of mind.

It is only the Venerable, himself, that gives rise to differentiated perception! If one has left their home for the Buddha Dharma, having such differentiation is not in accord with the Dharma. Observe all the bodhisattvas, to whom the flowers are not attached. It is because they have cut off all differentiated perceptions. It is just like when someone is afraid - the inhuman are able to control them. Like this, because the disciples fear birth & death (saṃsāra), visible forms, sounds, scents, flavors, and bodily sensations are able to control them.

<<< The Goddess said, “Because I use the dharma of Voice Hearers to convert sentient beings, I am for the Voice Hearer (śrāvaka). Because I use the Dharma of Dependent Origination to convert sentient beings, I am for the solitary buddha (pratyekabuddha). As I use the Dharma of Great Compassion, I am for the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna).”

“Śāriputra! Like someone who enters a forest of campaka (Michelia champaka). They will only be able to smell campaka, they will not smell other scents. Like this, if someone enters this room, they will only hear of scent of the merit of the Buddha. They will not delight in hearing about the scents of merit of voice hearers and solitary buddhas.”

“Śāriputra! Those Indras, Brahmas, four heavenly kings, all the devas, nagas, and other spirits who have entered this room to hear this superior person explain the Correct Dharma, they all delight in scent of the merit of the Buddha, and generate a mind set on bringing them about.”

“Śāriputra! I have been abiding in this room for twelve years. From the outset, I have not heard voice hearer of solitary buddha Dharma explained. I have only heard about the bodhisattva’s great kindness and great compassion, and all the inconceivable Dharma of the Buddha.”

“Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests eight unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharmas. What eight? This room is always illuminated with a golden light that doesn’t change, day or night; an illumination not of the Sun or Moon. This is the first unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. Those who enter this room are not afflicted by defilements. This is the second unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. This room always has Indras, Brahmas, the four heavenly kings, and bodhisattvas from their regions who come together uninterruptedly. This is the third unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. In this room the irreversible Dharma of the Six Paramitas is constantly explained. This is the fourth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. This room constantly makes the foremost delightful music of heavenly beings which transforms into the immeasurable sound of the Dharma. This is the fifth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma.   This room has four great treasuries, filled with masses of jewels that are given to the poor and used to help those in need, without ever being depleted. This is the sixth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. In this room, when this superior person [Vimalakīrti] is mindful of Śākyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha, Akṣobhya Buddha, ‘Jewel Virtue’ (Ratnaśrī), ‘Jewel Mirage’ (Ratnācis), ‘Jewel Moon’ (Ratnacandra), ‘Jewel Array’ (Ratnayūha), ‘Difficult to Conquer’ (Sudurjayā), ‘Lion’s Echo’ (Siṃhakīrti), and Achieving All Benefits (Sarvārthasiddha), all the immeasurable buddhas of the ten directions such as these all come at once and broadly expound the secrets and essentials of the Dharma Treasury. And when they have finished explaining, they leave and return [to that direction]. This is the seventh unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. In this room appear all the decorated palaces of the heavens and all the pure lands of the Buddhas. This is the eighth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma.”

<<< Vimalakīrti said, “Ah, Śāriputra! Those who seek the Dharma are not desirous of [even] life or limb, so what about a seat? Those who seek the Dharma seek [that which is] without form, sensation, perception, conditioning, or consciousness. They seek [that which is] without [there being sense] realms to enter. They seek [that which is] without desire, form, or formlessness. Ah, Śāriputra! Those who seek the Dharma seek without attachment to the Buddha. They seek without attachment to the Dharma. They seek without attachment to the Sangha. Those who seek the Dharma seek without seeing suffering. They seek without cutting off the accumulation [of suffering]. They seek without realizing the cessation [suffering] and without cultivating the [Eightfold] Path. How is it so? The Dharma is without contrived theories. If someone says that I should see suffering, cut off [its] accumulation, realize [its] cessation, and cultivate the Path, then this is just contrived theory and not seeking the Dharma. Ah, Śāriputra! The Dharma is called ‘calm cessation’ [nirvāṇa]. If one practices arising and ceasing, this is seeking arising and ceasing, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is called ‘untainted’ [mixed, stained]. If one is ‘tainted’ in regard to dharmas, even up to Nirvāṇa, *this is tainted attachment, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma has no where to be practiced. If one practices somewhere, then that is somewhere to practice, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without grasping or letting go. If one grasps at or lets go of things (dharmas), then this is grasping and letting go, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is not a refuge. If one needs a refuge, then that is a refuge, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is called ‘characteristicless.’ If one’s consciousness flows in accord with characteristics this is seeking characteristics, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is unable to abide. If one abides in *dharmas then this is a ‘dharma abiding’, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, or understood. If one sees, hears, or understands, then this is seeing, hearing, and understanding, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is [the] unconditioned. If one practices with[in] conditions this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Dharma. For this reason, Śāriputra! If one seeks the Dharma, one should not seek any thing (dharma) at all.”

<<< Vimalakīrti said, “Ah, Śāriputra! All buddhas and bodhisattvas have a liberation (vimokṣa) called ‘Inconceivable’ (Acintya). For the bodhisattva who abides in this liberation, the height and the breadth of Sumeru may be placed inside a mustard seed without any increase or decrease. Since Sumeru, the king of mountains, maintains its original characteristics, the four great heavenly kings, and all the devas of the trāyastriṃśas are not aware, do not know that they have entered [a mustard seed]. Only those bound for the other shore see Mt. Sumeru enter into a mustard seed. This is called abiding in the ‘dharma door’ of the Inconceivable Liberation.”

“[One may] also cause the waters of the four great oceans to enter into a single hair pore without discomforting the fish, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and [other] aquatic life forms, and the original characteristics of those great oceans [remain just] as before. The nagas, spirits, and asuras do not realize that they have entered [into a single hair pore].  At this, all the sentient beings are not discomforted.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation cuts off grasping the Three Thousand Great Thousand World System, and just like a potter grasping [their] wheel in their right palm, they throw it past world systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, and the sentient beings within are unaware of where they have gone. Also, when it returns to its original location, none of them have any perception of having gone or returned, and the original characteristics of these world systems are just as before.”

“Also, Śāriputra! If there are sentient beings who can be liberated through their desire for longevity, a bodhisattva will extend seven days into an entire kalpa and cause those sentient beings to consider it a kalpa. If there are sentient beings who can be liberated through their desire for brevity of lifespan, a bodhisattva will compress an entire kalpa into seven days and cause those sentient beings to consider it [only] seven days.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can accumulate the adornments of all buddha lands and manifest them to all sentient beings in a single country. Also, a bodhisattva can take the sentient beings of a buddha land in the right palm and fly to all ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from the original location.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva can make all the items offered to the buddhas by [all] the sentient beings throughout the ten directions visible in a single hair pore. Also, they can make visible all the suns, moons, and constellations of the countries of the ten directions.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva can inhale through the mouth all the winds of the world systems in the ten directions without harming the body, and all the trees outside not being damaged. Also, during the kalpa-ending conflagration by of the world systems of the ten directions, the can take all the fires within his abdomen, and though the fires will be as before they will not be harmed. Also, passing beyond buddha world systems in the lower direction more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River, they can take a single buddha land and lift it up in the upper direction, passing beyond world systems more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River, like they are holding a needle or a thorn, not inconvenienced [at all by doing so].”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation is able to use their spiritual powers to manifest the body of a buddha, or to manifest the body of a pratyeka-buddha, or to manifest the body of a śrāvaka, or to manifest the body of Indra, or to manifest the body of Brahma, or to manifest the body of a world lord, or to manifest the body of a wheel-turning sage king. They are also able to transform all the voices throughout the world systems - high, medium, and low - into the voices of the buddha, making the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self. Also, all the various kinds of Dharmas explained by the buddhas of the ten directions are heard everywhere in those sounds.”

“Śāriputra! I have now briefly explained the power of the bodhisattva’s Inconceivable Liberation. If I were to explain it extensively, a kalpa could pass and I would still not be finished.”
>>> 是時大迦葉聞說菩薩不可思議解脫法門，歎未曾有，謂舍利弗：「譬如有人，於盲者前現眾色像，非彼所見；一切聲聞聞是不可思議解脫法門，不能解了，為若此也！智者聞是，其誰不發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心？我等何為永絕其根，於此大乘，已如敗種！一切聲聞聞是不可思議解脫法門，皆應號泣，聲震三千大千世界；一切菩薩應大欣慶，頂受此法。若有菩薩信解不可思議解脫法門者，一切魔眾無如之何。」大迦葉說是語時，三萬二千天子皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。
<<< At that moment Mahākāśyapa, hearing this explanation of the bodhisattva’s Inconceivable Liberation, sighed at what he had never heard before and said to Śāriputra, “It is like someone putting various painted images before a blind person. They are not being seen. All the śrāvakas hear this Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door, but they are unable to understand it, even though it’s there! If a wise person hears this, who wouldn’t generate anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta? How have we cut off our capacities for this Great Vehicle for so long, just like destroyed seeds? All the śrāvakas, hearing this Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door, should all cry out with a voice that shakes the Three Thousand Great Thousand World System, and all the bodhisattvas should be anointed by joy at receiving this Dharma. If a bodhisattva is ‘faithfully liberated’ in the Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door, what could the Hordes of Mara do?”

When Mahākāśyapa gave said these things, thirty-two thousand godlings all generated anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.

<<< Then Vimalakīrti said to Mahākāśyapa, “Venerable! Those that make [act as] Mara Kings within immeasurable asaṃkhyeya world systems throughout the Ten Directions, many are bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation. By the power of skillful means they teach and transform sentient beings, appearing to act as Mara Kings.”

“Also, Kāśyapa! The immeasurable Bodhisattvas throughout the Ten Directions - people come to them begging for a hand, a foot, an ear, or nose; their head, eyes, marrow or brains; blood, flesh, skin, and bone; their gatherings and settlements, their cities and states; their spouses and children, servants and slaves; elephants, horses, carts and vehicles; gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, and conch shells; cloth and clothing, drink and food - like this, people begging, many are bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation. By the power of skillful means, they go to test the [bodhisattvas] resolve. How so? A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation has awesome ‘virtue power’ and can, therefore, practice ‘compelling’, demonstrating such hardships of sentient beings. Ordinary people are inferior. They are without the power and unable to ‘compel’ bodhisattvas like this. It is just like the kicking or trampling of a dragon or elephant. No donkey could withstand it. This is called abiding in the gateway of bodhisattva’s Wisdom and Skillful Means of the Inconceivable Liberation.”

>>> 時維摩詰知其意而語言：「佛說八解脫，仁者受行，豈雜欲食而聞法乎？若欲食者，且待須臾，當令汝得未曾有食。」
<<< Then Vimalakīrti, knowing his thoughts, said, “The Buddha has explained the eight emancipations, and the Venerable has accepted their practice. How can you mix up the desire for food and the desire for listening to the Dharma? If you want to eat, just wait a moment and you will be provided with an unprecedented meal.”
>>> 時維摩詰即入三昧，以神通力示諸大眾，上方界分過四十二恒河沙佛土，有國名眾香，佛號香積，今現在，其國香氣，比於十方諸佛世界人、天之香，最為第一。彼土無有聲聞、辟支佛名，唯有清淨大菩薩眾，佛為說法。其界一切，皆以香作樓閣，經行香地，苑園皆香，其食香氣，周流十方無量世界。時彼佛與諸菩薩方共坐食，有諸天子皆號香嚴，悉發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，供養彼佛及諸菩薩，此諸大眾莫不目見。
<<< Then Vimalakīrti entered samadhi, and by the power of spiritual penetration, manifested to the great gathering that, in the upper direction past buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, there is a land called Gathered Fragrances, with a buddha named
Accumulation of Fragrances, who currently exists in that world. In comparison with the world-systems of the other buddhas throughout the ten directions, the fragrances experienced by the humans and gods of that country are supreme. In that land, the names ‘voice hearer’ (śrāvaka) and ‘solitary buddha’ (pratyekabuddha) do not exist—there is only the great gathering of pure bodhisattvas, for whom the Buddha explains the Dharma. In that world, all the buildings are made of fragrances. In doing walking meditation on that fragrant earth, the gardens are all fragrant. The fragrance of the food there circulates throughout the immeasurable worlds in the ten directions. When that Buddha and all the bodhisattvas sit together to eat, the gods in attendance all exclaim ornamental fragrances and all generate anuttarā samyak-saṃbodhi citta and make offerings to that buddha and the bodhisattvas. Everyone in the great gathering witnessed what they had never seen before.
>>> 時維摩詰問眾菩薩言：「諸仁者！誰能致彼佛飯？」以文殊師利威神力故，咸皆默然。維摩詰言：「仁此大眾，無乃可恥？」
<<< Then Vimalakīrti asked all the bodhisattvas, “Venerables! Who is able to go get food from that buddha?” But, due to the influence of Mañjuśrī’s spiritual power, they all remained silent. Vimalakīrti said, “Venerable, this great assembly, is it not shameful?”
>>> 文殊師利曰：「如佛所言，勿輕未學。」
<<< Mañjuśrī replied, “As the Buddha has said, one should not put down those who have not learned.”
>>> 於是維摩詰不起于座，居眾會前，化作菩薩，相好光明，威德殊勝，蔽於眾會，而告之曰：「汝往上方界分，度如四十二恒河沙佛土，有國名眾香，佛號香積，與諸菩薩方共坐食。汝往到彼，如我辭曰：『維摩詰稽首世尊足下！致敬無量，問訊起居，少病少惱，氣力安不？願得世尊所食之餘，當於娑婆世界施作佛事，令此樂小法者得弘大道，亦使如來名聲普聞。』」
<<< At this Vimalakīrti, without rising from his seat, in front of everyone gathered in his house, created a bodhisattva by transformation with radiant auspicious characteristics and a glorious presence that surpassed everyone in the assembly and he told it, “Go to the world in the upper direction where, separated from here by buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, there is a land called Gathered Fragrances. The buddha [there] is named Accumulation of Fragrances. Along with all the bodhisattvas, they are just now sitting down to eat. Go there, and say as I tell you: ‘Vimalakīrti bows his head to the feet of the World-Honored One! With great respect he inquires immeasurable times, are your ills slight, some slight vexation, and whether your energies are at peace? He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World-Honored One’s meal, which would be given to accomplish the Buddha’s work in the Sahā world. It will cause those who delight in lesser dharmas to disseminate the great path, and it will also cause the name of the Thus Come One to be universally heard.’”
>>> 時化菩薩即於會前，昇于上方，舉眾皆見其去，到眾香界，禮彼佛足，又聞其言：「維摩詰稽首世尊足下！致敬無量，問訊起居，少病少惱，氣力安不？願得世尊所食之餘，欲於娑婆世界施作佛事，使此樂小法者得弘大道，亦使如來名聲普聞。」
<<< Then the transformation bodhisattva, in front of the assembly, ascended to the upper direction and the entire congregation saw him arrive at that Gathered Fragrances world-system and worship at that Buddha’s feet, and they also heard him say, “Vimalakīrti bows his head to the feet of the World-honored One, and with great respect he inquires immeasurable times, Are your ills slight, some slight vexation, and whether your energies are at peace? He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World-Honored One’s meal, which would be given to accomplish the Buddha’s work in the Sahā world. It will cause those who delight in ‘lesser dharmas’ to disseminate the great path, and it will also cause the name of the Thus Come One to be universally heard.”
>>> 彼諸大士見化菩薩，歎未曾有：「今此上人從何所來？娑婆世界為在何許？云何名為樂小法者？」即以問佛。佛告之曰：「下方度如四十二恒河沙佛土，有世界名娑婆，佛號釋迦牟尼，今現在。於五濁惡世，為樂小法眾生敷演道教；彼有菩薩名維摩詰，住不可思議解脫，為諸菩薩說法，故遣化來，稱揚我名，并讚此土，令彼菩薩增益功德。」
<<< When the great beings there saw the transformation bodhisattva, they exclaimed that it was unprecedented. “Where has this superior person come from? Where is the Sahā world? What does ‘those who delight in lesser dharmas’ mean?” So they asked the Buddha. The Buddha told them, “In the lower direction, separated from here by buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, is a world named Sahā. The buddha there is named Śākyamuni, who exists at present. In an evil time of five kaṣāya (stages of corruption), he broadly expounds the teaching of the path in order to enlighten those who delight in lesser dharmas. One of his bodhisattvas is named Vimalakīrti, who resides in the Inconceivable Liberation and explains the Dharma for  bodhisattvas. Therefore, he has sent this transformation here to praise my name and extol this land, so that those bodhisattvas will increase their merit.”
>>> 彼菩薩言：「其人何如，乃作是化？德力無畏，神足若斯！」佛言：「甚大！一切十方皆遣化往，施作佛事，饒益眾生。」
<<< Those bodhisattvas said, “Who is this person and how did they make this transformation? How great must his merit power, fearlessness, and spiritual powers be!”

The Buddha said, “Extremely great! He sends transformations throughout the ten directions, where they carry out the Buddha’s work and benefit sentient beings.”
>>> 於是香積如來以眾香鉢盛滿香飯，與化菩薩。時彼九百萬菩薩俱發聲言：「我欲詣娑婆世界供養釋迦牟尼佛，并欲見維摩詰等諸菩薩眾。」佛言：「可往。攝汝身香，無令彼諸眾生起惑著心。又當捨汝本形，勿使彼國求菩薩者，而自鄙恥。又汝於彼莫懷輕賤，而作礙想。所以者何？十方國土，皆如虛空。又諸佛為欲化諸樂小法者，不盡現其清淨土耳！」時化菩薩既受鉢飯，與彼九百萬菩薩俱，承佛威神，及維摩詰力，於彼世界，忽然不現，須臾之間，至維摩詰舍。
<<< At this, Accumulation of Fragrances Thus Come One shared a bowl full of gathered fragrances and fragrant food with the transformation bodhisattva. Then nine million bodhisattvas there together raised their voices saying, “We wish to go to the Sahā World to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. And we wish to see Vimalakīrti and all the other bodhisattvas. The Buddha said, “You can go, but withdraw the fragrances of your bodies, so as not to cause the sentient beings there to generate thoughts of deluded attachment. Also, you should relinquish your original forms, so as not to cause those bodhisattva seekers in that country to be ashamed of themselves. Also, you must not harbor feelings of belittlement or disgust, and create hindered perceptions. Why? All lands throughout the Ten Directions are all like empty space. Also, all buddhas do not completely manifest their pure lands because they want to transform those who delight in lesser dharma!” Then the transformation bodhisattva received the bowl of food and, with those nine million bodhisattvas, by means of the Buddha’s awesome spiritual [powers] and Vimalakīrti’s power, they  suddenly disappeared from that world and, in an instant, they arrived at Vimalakīrti’s house.
>>> 時維摩詰即化作九百萬師子之座，嚴好如前，諸菩薩皆坐其上。是化菩薩以滿鉢香飯與維摩詰，飯香普熏毘耶離城，及三千大千世界。時毘耶離婆羅門、居士等，聞是香氣，身意快然，歎未曾有！於是長者主月蓋從八萬四千人，來入維摩詰舍。見其室中菩薩甚多，諸師子座，高廣嚴好，皆大歡喜，禮眾菩薩及大弟子，却住一面。諸地神、虛空神及欲、色界諸天，聞此香氣，亦皆來入維摩詰舍。
<<< Then Vimalakīrti created by transformation nine million lion seats, excellently ornamented as before, and the bodhisattvas all sat upon them. When the transformation bodhisattva gave the bowl full of fragrant food to Vimalakīrti, the fragrance of the food permeated the city of Vaiśālī and the entire Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system. Then the Brāhmans and retired scholars of Vaiśālī smelled this fragrance and their bodies and minds were joyful, and they sighed at the unprecedented. At this, a chief of the elders, Moon Canopy, followed by eighty-four thousand people, came and entered Vimalakīrti’s house. Seeing so many bodhisattvas inside the room, and all the lion seats, so tall and so broad, with the finest ornamentation, they were all great joyful and revered the gathering of bodhisattvas and great disciples, then stood to one side. [And] all the earth spirits, sky [or space] spirits, and gods of the realms of desire and form smelled this fragrance, also coming and entering Vimalakīrti’s house.
>>> 時維摩詰語舍利弗等諸大聲聞：「仁者可食，如來甘露味飯，大悲所熏，無以限意食之，使不消也。」有異聲聞念：「是飯少，而此大眾人人當食？」化菩薩曰：「勿以聲聞小德小智，稱量如來無量福慧！四海有竭，此飯無盡！使一切人食，揣若須彌，乃至一劫，猶不能盡。所以者何？無盡戒、定、智慧、解脫、解脫知見功德具足者，所食之餘，終不可盡。」於是鉢飯悉飽眾會，猶故不[歹*斯]。其諸菩薩、聲聞、天、人，食此飯者，身安快樂，譬如一切樂莊嚴國諸菩薩也；又諸毛孔皆出妙香，亦如眾香國土諸樹之香。
<<< Then Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra and the other great voice hearers, “Venerables, you may eat this  food of the flavor of sweet dew of the Thus Come One, which is perfumed with the limitless intention of great compassion, and which will not be diminished by its consumption.”

A different voice hearer thought, “There is not much food, yet everyone in this great assembly is supposed to eat!”

The transformation bodhisattva said, “Do not measure the limitless blessings and sagacity of the Thus Come One with the small merit and small wisdom of a voice hearer! Even were the four seas to dry up, this food would not be exhausted. Even if everyone ate as much as Sumeru for an entire kalpa, we would never be able to exhaust it. Why? That which is left over from the meal of someone who fully possesses the merits of morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the vision and hearing of emancipation can never be exhausted.”

Then the food in the bowl was used to satisfy the gathered assembly, yet it remained just as it was, without depletion. All the bodhisattvas, voice hearers, gods and humans eating the food had a sense of bodily ease and delight of mind, just as every bodhisattva delights in adorning lands, and a wonderful scent also emitted from the hair pores of their bodies, like the scents of all the trees of Land of Gathered Fragrances.”
>>> 爾時維摩詰問眾香菩薩：「香積如來以何說法？」
<<< Then Vimalakīrti asked the Gathered Fragrances bodhisattvas, “How does Accumulation of Fragrances Thus Come One explain the Dharma?”
>>> 彼菩薩曰：「我土如來無文字說，但以眾香令諸天、人得入律行。菩薩各各坐香樹下，聞斯妙香，即獲一切德藏三昧。得是三昧者，菩薩所有功德皆悉具足。」
<<< Those bodhisattvas replied, “The Thus Come One of our land does not explain with words and letters, simply by using gathered fragrances do all gods and humans enter disciplined practice. Bodhisattvas each sit beneath a fragrant tree and smell such wondrous fragrances that they ‘catch’ (attain) all the virtuous treasuries of samādhi. Those who attain this samādhi all become replete in the merits of a bodhisattva.”
>>> 彼諸菩薩問維摩詰：「今世尊釋迦牟尼以何說法？」
<<< All those bodhisattvas then asked Vimalakīrti, “How does the World-Honored One Śākyamuni explain the Dharma here?”
>>> 維摩詰言：「此土眾生剛強難化，故佛為說剛強之語以調伏之。言是地獄、是畜生、是餓鬼，是諸難處，是愚人生處；是身邪行，是身邪行報；是口邪行，是口邪行報；是意邪行，是意邪行報；是殺生，是殺生報；是不與取，是不與取報；是邪婬，是邪婬報；是妄語，是妄語報；是兩舌，是兩舌報；是惡口，是惡口報；是無義語，是無義語報；是貪嫉，是貪嫉報；是瞋惱，是瞋惱報；是邪見，是邪見報；是慳悋，是慳悋報；是毀戒，是毀戒報；是瞋恚，是瞋恚報；是懈怠，是懈怠報；是亂意，是亂意報；是愚癡，是愚癡報；是結戒，是持戒，是犯戒；是應作，是不應作；是障礙，是不障礙；是得罪，是離罪；是淨，是垢；是有漏，是無漏；是邪道，是正道；是有為，是無為；是世間，是涅槃。以難化之人，心如猨猴，故以若干種法，制御其心，乃可調伏。譬如象馬，[怡-台+龍]悷不調，加諸楚毒，乃至徹骨，然後調伏。如是剛強難化眾生，故以一切苦切之言，乃可入律。」
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “The sentient beings of this land are obdurate and difficult to convert, and so the Buddha disciplines them by means of stern language. He says, ‘There are the hells, there are animals, and there are hungry ghosts. These are the places of difficulty, and these are the places
where the foolish are born. These are improper practices of the body, and these are the retributions for improper practices of the body. These are improper practices of the mouth, and these are the retributions for improper practices of the mouth. These are improper practices of the mind, and these are the retributions for improper practices of the mind. This is to kill sentient beings, and this is the retribution for killing sentient beings. This is to take what is not given, and this is the retribution for taking what is not given. This is improper behavior, and this is the retribution for
improper behavior. This is false speech, and this is the retribution for false speech. This is slander, and this is the retribution for slander. This is defamation, and this is the retribution for defamation. This is idle speech, and this is the retribution for idle speech. These are desire and jealousy, and this is the retribution for desire and jealousy. These are anger and vexation, and this is the retribution for anger and vexation. These are heterodox views, and this is the retribution for heterodox views. This is parsimony, and this is the retribution for parsimony. This is breaking the precepts, and this is the retribution for breaking the precepts. This is anger, and this is the retribution for anger. This is
laziness, and this is the retribution for laziness. This is perturbation, and this is the retribution for perturbation. This is stupidity, and this is the retribution for stupidity. This is to be bound by the precepts, this is to maintain the precepts, and this is to transgress the precepts. This is what you should do, and this is what you should not do. These are hindrances, and these are not hindrances.
These are transgressions, and these are not transgressions. This is pure, and this is defiled. This is to have flaws, and this is to be flawless. This is the wrong path, and this is the correct path. This is the conditioned, and this is the unconditioned. This is worldly, and this is Nirvana.’”

“Since the minds of people so difficult to convert are like monkeys, one must use several types of Dharma to control their minds, so that they can be disciplined. It is like elephants and horses who are stubborn and uncontrollable, who can only be disciplined by making them suffer to the bone. Because sentient beings are obdurate like this, [The Buddha] uses all sorts of strict language to get [sentient beings] to enter disciplined practice.”
>>> 彼諸菩薩聞說是已，皆曰：「未曾有也！如世尊釋迦牟尼佛，隱其無量自在之力，乃以貧所樂法，度脫眾生；斯諸菩薩亦能勞謙，以無量大悲，生是佛土。」
<<< When those bodhisattvas heard this explanation, they all said, “Unprecedented! Thus the World-honored One Śākyamuni Buddha conceals his immeasurable autonomous powers and uses that which is enjoyed by the poverty-stricken to free sentient beings. The bodhisattvas here are also able to labor and be humble, and it is with immeasurable great compassion that they have been born in this Buddha Land.”
>>> 維摩詰言：「此土菩薩於諸眾生大悲堅固，誠如所言。然其一世饒益眾生，多於彼國百千劫行。所以者何？此娑婆世界有十事善法，諸餘淨土之所無有。何等為十？以布施攝貧窮，以淨戒攝毀禁，以忍辱攝瞋恚，以精進攝懈怠，以禪定攝亂意，以智慧攝愚癡，說除難法度八難者，以大乘法度樂小乘者，以諸善根濟無德者，常以四攝成就眾生，是為十。」
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattvas of this land are resolute in their compassion for all sentient beings. Truly, it is as you have said. Thus in a single lifetime they benefit more sentient beings than you do in that country in a hundred thousand kalpas of practice. Why? This Sahā world has ten excellent dharmas (things about them) that are lacking in the other pure lands. What are these ten?1. The poor are attracted by Giving; 2. transgressors are attracted by pure Precepts; 3. the angry are attracted by Patience; 4. the lazy are attracted by Determination; 5. the crazed are attracted by meditation; 6. the foolish are attracted by Wisdom; 7. those who experience the eight difficulties are liberated by explanation of the Dharma on eliminating difficulties; 8. those who delight in the Hinayana are liberated by the Mahayana; 9. those without virtue are ‘ferried’ by all good roots; and 10. all sentient beings are liberated by the Four Means of ‘Attraction’ (inclusion). These are the ten.”
>>> 彼菩薩曰：「菩薩成就幾法？於此世界行無瘡疣，生于淨土。」
<<< Those bodhisattvas said, “How many dharmas do bodhisattvas accomplish in their flawless practice in this world to be born in[to] a pure land?”
>>> 維摩詰言：「菩薩成就八法，於此世界行無瘡疣，生于淨土。何等為八？饒益眾生，而不望報；代一切眾生受諸苦惱，所作功德盡以施之；等心眾生，謙下無礙；於諸菩薩視之如佛；所未聞經，聞之不疑；不與聲聞而相違背；不嫉彼供，不高己利，而於其中調伏其心；常省己過，不訟彼短，恒以一心求諸功德，是為八法。」
<<< Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas accomplish eight dharmas in their flawless practice in this world to be born in[to] a pure land. What are the eight? 1. They benefit sentient beings without seeking anything in return; 2. they take upon themselves the sufferings of all living beings, and what merit they acquire thereby is given to those beings; 3. they are even-minded toward all sentient beings, humble and non-contrarian; 4. they see bodhisattvas as if they are buddhas; 5. they hear and do not doubt sutras they have not heard before; 6. they do not dispute voice hearers; 7. they do not envy the alms received by others, nor boast of their own gains, and, in all of this, their minds are disciplined; 8. they always reflect on their own errors and do not point out the shortcomings of others, they just single mindedly seek all virtues. These are the eight.
>>> 維摩詰、文殊師利於大眾中說是法時，百千天、人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，十千菩薩得無生法忍。
<<< When Vimalakīrti and Mañjuśrī explained this Dharma to the great congregation, a hundred thousand gods and humans all generated anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta, and ten thousand bodhisattvas attained the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of dharmas.

>>> 法供養品第十三
<<< DHARMA OFFERINGS
>>> 爾時釋提桓因於大眾中白佛言：「世尊！我雖從佛及文殊師利聞百千經，未曾聞此不可思議，自在神通，決定實相經典。如我解佛所說義趣，若有眾生聞是經法，信解受持讀誦之者，必得是法不疑，何況如說修行？斯人即為閉眾惡趣開諸善門，常為諸佛之所護念；降伏外學，摧滅魔怨；修治菩提，安處道場；履踐如來所行之跡。世尊！若有受持讀誦如說修行者，我當與諸眷屬供養給事；所在聚落城邑、山林曠野，有是經處，我亦與諸眷屬，聽受法故共到其所；其未信者，當令生信；其已信者，當為作護。」
<<< At that time, Śakra Devānām Indra, who was in the great congregation, addressed the Buddha saying, “World-honored One!  Though I have heard hundreds and thousands of sutras from the Buddha and Mañjuśrī, I have never heard one with such inconceivable, sovereign spiritual power,
and such definitive grasp of True Thusness. According to my understanding of what the Buddha has just said, if there are living beings who hear this sutra on the Dharma, believe and understand it,
accept and uphold it, read and recite it, then they will surely and without doubt acquire that Dharma. How much more so if they practice it as the Dharma directs. Such people will shut off all evil paths of existence and open the gates to all good ones. They will be constantly guarded and kept in mind by the Buddhas; will refute outside teachings and overcome the animosity of Mara; will cultivate and practice bodhi, and abide at the site of enlightenment; following in the way trod by the Thus Come One. World-Honored One! If there are people who accept and uphold, read and recite this sutra and practice it as the Dharma directs, then I and my followers will offer alms to them and serve them. And if there is a place among the villages or towns, the mountain forests or the broad plain where this sutra exists, then I and my followers will go there together to listen to and accept the Dharma; and those who do not yet believe in it I will lead to belief, and to those who already believe I will be a guardian.”
>>> 佛言：「善哉，善哉！天帝！如汝所說，吾助爾喜。此經廣說過去、未來、現在諸佛不可思議阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。是故，天帝！若善男子、善女人，受持、讀誦、供養是經者，即為供養去、來、今佛。
<<< The Buddha said, “Excellent! Excellent! Heavenly Lord! As you have said, and I will assist you in your joyful task. This sutra broadly explains the inconceivable anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi of all buddhas of the past, future, and present. Therefore, Heavenly Lord! If good men and good women are able to receive, retain, read, and recite, and make offerings to this sutra, it is the same as making offerings to past, future, and present buddhas.”
>>> 「天帝！正使三千大千世界如來滿中，譬如甘蔗、竹[竺-二+韋]、稻麻、叢林；若有善男子、善女人，或一劫、或減一劫，恭敬尊重，讚歎供養，奉諸所安，至諸佛滅後，以一一全身舍利起七寶塔，縱廣一四天下，高至梵天，表剎莊嚴；以一切華香、瓔珞、幢幡、伎樂微妙第一，若一劫、若減一劫，而供養之。於天帝意云何，其人植福，寧為多不？」
<<< “Heavenly Lord, suppose this Three Thousand Great Thousand World-System were as full of Thus Come Ones as it is of sugarcane, bamboo, reeds, rice and hemp plants, or forest trees. If there were good men or good women who for the span of a kalpa, or less than a kalpa, were to revere and honor, praise and make offerings to them and provide for their well-being; and if after those Buddhas had passed away, these people built towers adorned with the seven treasures to house the relics from each Buddha body, towers so broad they covered the four continents and so high they
reached to the Brahma heaven, their central pole richly decorated; and if these people made offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, necklaces, flags, pennants, and music, all of the most
refined and wonderful kind, and did this for the space of a kalpa, or less than a kalpa—Heavenly Lord, what do you think? Would these people have thereby planted the seeds of much merit, or not?"

<<< The Buddha told the Heavenly Lord, “You should know, good men and good women who hear this sutra on the Inconceivable Liberation and have faith in it, understand, receive, retain, read, recite and practice it, the merit will be greater than that. How so? Because the bodhi of the Buddhas is all born from this sutra. The characteristic of bodhi is beyond limit or measure, and for that reason the merit is immeasurable."

<<< The Buddha told the Heavenly Lord, “Immeasurable asamkhya kalpas in the past, there was
a Buddha in the world named Medicine King, Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, of right and universal knowledge, perfect clarity and conduct, well gone, understanding the world, unexcelled
noble, trainer of people, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The world was called Great Adornment and the kalpa was called Adornment. This Buddha had a life span of twenty small kalpas. The voice-hearer monks numbered thirty-six million nayutas and bodhisattva
monks were twelve million. Heavenly Noble! At that time there was a wheel-turning sage
king named Jeweled Parasol, replete with the seven treasures, ruler of the four continents. This king
had a thousand children, upright, valiant, capable of overpowering their enemies.”
>>> 「爾時寶蓋與其眷屬供養藥王如來，施諸所安，至滿五劫。過五劫已，告其千子：『汝等亦當如我，以深心供養於佛。』於是千子受父王命，供養藥王如來，復滿五劫，一切施安。其王一子，名曰月蓋，獨坐思惟：『寧有供養殊過此者？』以佛神力，空中有天曰：『善男子！法之供養勝諸供養。』即問：『何謂法之供養？』天曰：『汝可往問藥王如來，當廣為汝說法之供養。』
<<< At that time Jeweled Parasol came with his retinue to make offerings to the Medicine King Thus Come One, providing him with all he needed for his well-being. He did this for five whole kalpas. When five kalpas had passed, he said to his thousand children, 'You too should make offerings as I have to the Buddha, with the same profound mind. The thousand children, obeying their father's command, proceeded to make offerings to the Medicine King Thus Come One for another five full kalpas, providing him with everything needed for his well-being. One child of the king named Moon Parasol sat all alone, thinking, 'Isn't there some offering that is better than these?' Then, by the spiritual power of the Buddha, a deva appeared in the sky and said, 'Kulaputra! The offering of the Dharma is the finest of all offerings!' The child asked, 'What is offering the Dharma?' The deva being replied, 'You should go and ask the Medicine King Thus Come One. He will explain to you in detail offering the Dharma.'

<<< "Then the king’s child Moon Parasol went to visit the Medicine King Thus Come One, bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, stood to one side and addressed the Buddha, saying, 'World-Honored One! Among all offerings, the offering of the Dharma is the finest. But what is offering the Dharma?' The Buddha said, 'Kulaputa! Offering the Dharma means all the profound sutras spoken by the Buddhas, which are difficult to believe and difficult to accept throughout all worldly realms, for they are wonderfully subtle and difficult to see, clean and pure, without stain, incapable of being grasped through the making of distinctions or through thought. They are contained within the Dharma Treasury of the Bodhisattva and sealed with the dharani seal. They lead to non-regression and accomplishment of the Six Paramitas, skillful discrimination of meaning, and conformity with bodhi Dharma, the highest of all the classics (sutras). They lead to great kindness and compassion, freedom from the activities of Māra and all false views. They conform with the Dharmas of dependent-origination, the absence of self, the absence of individuality, the absence of sentience, the absence of life-span, emptiness, characteristiclessness, aimlessness, and non-origination. They are able to cause sentient beings to sit upon the site of enlightenment, to turn the Dharma Wheel, and they are praised by all the devas, nagas, spirits, gandharvas, and so on. They are able to make sentient beings enter the treasury of Buddha-Dharma, and embrace all the wisdom of worthies and sages. They explain the path practiced by the host of bodhisattvas dependent upon the meaning of the True Characteristic of dharmas. They illuminate the dharmas of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, and cessation, and they are able to save all sentient beings who are transgressive. They can render afraid the Māras, heretics, and those attached to desire. They are praised by all the buddhas, worthies, and sages. They reject the suffering of birth & death and reveal the joy of Nirvana, as explained by all the buddhas of the ten directions and three periods of time. If one hears such sutras, and devoutly understands, accepts and maintains, and reads and recites them, will with the power of upaya explain them clearly and with discriminative understanding for sentient beings. This is because that person will be maintaining and protecting the Dharma. This is called ‘offering the Dharma.’ Furthermore, when one practices the Dharma as explained, one will be in accord with the twelve [links of] dependent-origination, transcend false views, and attain the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of dharmas. There definitively being no self and no sentient beings, therefore there is no disagreement, no contention with the results of dependent-origination, transcending all the aspects of self. Reliant upon meaning, not upon words. Reliant upon wisdom, not upon consciousness. Reliant upon sutras of comprehensive meaning, not upon sutras of incomplete meaning. Reliant upon the Dharma, not upon people. Being in accord with the characteristics of dharmas, without anywhere to enter, without any refuge. Because ignorance is thoroughly extinguished, all conditioning (saṃskāra) is thoroughly extinguished. Because birth, as well, is thoroughly extinguished, old age and death are thoroughly extinguished. Observing like this, the twelve [links of] dependent-origination are without the characteristic of exhaustion, no longer giving rise to views, this is called the supreme ‘offering the Dharma.’

<<< The Buddha told the Heavenly Lord, “The king’s child Moon Canopy, hearing this Dharma from Medicine King Buddha, attained conforming patience. Taking off his jeweled robe and bodily ornaments, he offered them to the Buddha, saying ‘World-honored One! After the extinction of the Thus Come One, I will practice the ‘offering of the Dharma’ and protect the correct Dharma. Please
use your majestic power compassionately, so that I will be able to tame the vengeful Māras and cultivate the practices of the bodhisattva.’ The buddha, knowing the profound thoughts in [the child’s] mind, made the prediction, “In times to come, you will protect the City of Dharma.”

“Heavenly Lord! The king’s child Moon Canopy then saw the purity of the Dharma. Hearing the Buddha bestow this prediction, he developed faith and left home. After cultivating the good Dharma with exertion for not very long, he attained the five spiritual powers and became a bodhisattva. He attained dhāraṇīs and unending eloquence. After the extinction of that buddha, using those spiritual powers, dhāraṇīs, and power of eloquence, he disseminated the wheel of the Dharma that Medicine King Buddha had turned for a full ten short kalpas. Through his diligent practice and exertion in protecting the Dharma, in that lifetime Moon Canopy bhikṣu converted a
million koṭis of people irreversibly to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Fourteen nayutas of people generated the profound inspiration to become śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Immeasurable sentient beings gained birth in the heavens. Heavenly Lord! What kind of person was King Jeweled Canopy of that time? As of now they have attained buddhahood and are called Jewel Mirage Thus Come One. Those thousand children of the king became the thousand buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa (’Worthy Kalpa’). The first achieved buddhahood as Krakucchandra, and the last will be the Thus Come One named Ruci. Moon Canopy bhikṣu was I myself. Therefore, Heavenly Lord, you should understand this essential point: offering the Dharma excels all other offerings. It is supreme, incomparable. Therefore, Heavenly Lord, you should use the offering of the Dharma to make offerings to the buddhas.”

I remember, once in the past, when I was sitting in peaceful meditation under a tree in the forest. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Śāriputra! You should not take this [sort of] sitting as peaceful sitting! Peaceful sitting means that in this threefold world you manifest neither body nor mind. This is peaceful sitting. Not rising out of samādhi of complete cessation and yet showing yourself in the ceremonies of daily life, this is peaceful sitting. Not abandoning the Way of the Dharma, yet showing yourself in common activities, this is peaceful sitting. The mind not fixed on internal things and yet not engaged with externals either, this is peaceful sitting. Unmoved by different views, yet practicing the thirty-seven aids to Awakening, this is peaceful sitting. Entering nirvana without having put an end to worldly desires, this is peaceful sitting. If you can sit like this, you will earn the Buddha's seal [mudra] of approval.”

World-Honored One! When I heard him say these words, I stood silent, unable to respond! For this reason, I cannot bare to inquire about his illness.”

>>> Maudgalyāyana replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I entered the great city of Vaiśālī and in its streets and lanes explaining the Dharma for the lay believers. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Mahāmaudgalyāyana! You should not explain the Dharma for the white-robed lay believers as the Venerable is explaining. One explaining the Dharma should explain like the Dharma.’

‘The Dharma is without sentient beings for being free from the defilement of sentient being(s). The Dharma is without an existent self for being free from the defilement of the self. The Dharma is without lifespan for being free from birth & death. The Dharma is without an existent individual for having severed connection to past and future. The Dharma is in constant stillness for having extinguished all characteristics. The Dharma is free of characteristics for being without anything conditional. The Dharma is without names and letters for having severed all [connection to] speech and language. The Dharma is inexplicable for being free from conceptualization. The Dharma is without characteristics for being like empty space. The Dharma is without idle imaginations (prapañca) for being ultimately empty. The Dharma is without any ‘mine’ for being free of [the duality ‘me’ and] ‘mine’. The Dharma is without differentiation for being free of all consciousness. The Dharma is without comparison for not having any characteristics to grab. The Dharma is not caused for not having location or condition. The Dharma is that nature of Dharmas for entering all things (dharmas). The Dharma conforms with Thusness for there is nothing else to conform to. The Dharma abides at the Limit of Reality for being unmoved by anything on the periphery. The Dharma is immovable for not depending on the ‘Six Dusts’ (six sense media). The Dharma is without coming or going for it never abides anywhere to begin with. The Dharma is in accord with emptiness, in accord with characteristiclessness, in accord with desirelessness [without the desire for outcomes]. The Dharma is free from beauty and ugliness. The Dharma is without increase or decrease. The Dharma is without arising and ceasing. The Dharma is without destination. The Dharma transcends eyes, ears, the nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high or low. The Dharma constantly abides, without moving. The Dharma is beyond the practice of all contemplation.’

 'Ah, Mahāmaudgalyāyana! The Dharma being characterized thus, how could it be explained? Explaining the Dharma means not explaining, not demonstrating. Listen­ing to the Dharma means not listening, not grasping. It is like an illlusionist creating the illusion of someone explaining the Dharma. It is with this understanding that you should explain the Dharma. You should understand the capacities of living beings, keen and dull, and cultivate virtuous insight free from all impediments, with a mind steeped in great compassion, praise the Great Vehicle, and remember the debt of gratitude you owe the Buddha, never allowing the Three Treasures to come to an end, then you may explain the Dharma.’

“When Vimalakirti explained the Dharma like this, eight hundred lay believers generated anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta. I do not have such eloquence as this. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

>>> Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, I was begging for alms-food in a poor village. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Mahākāśyapa! You have a mind of loving-kindness and compassion, but you are unable to universally let go of poverty and wealth, and you beg out of poverty.’

‘Kāśyapa! You should beg for alms-food abiding in [Upeksha] the Dharma of Equanimity . There being no [such thing as] food, that is how you should beg for food.  Destroying the characteristic of unified entities, that is how you should accept clumps of food. Not accepting any thing, that is how you should accept food. Enter villages with the thought that they are empty villages. See all form(s) [rupa] as though blind; hear all sounds as echoes; smell all scents as the wind; taste all flavors as being undifferintiated; feel all textures as Realized Knowledge; and think of all things [dharmas] as illusory - without self-nature, without other-nature, unarisen from the beginning and therefore without cessation.’

‘Kāśyapa! If you are able to enter the Eight Liberations and not relinquish the eight errors, you enter the correct Dharma through the characteristic of error. If, by one given meal, you can feed everyone, and make offerings to all Buddhas, sages and worthy persons, then you can eat. Eating like this is neither with defilement nor free of defilement; it neither enters a meditative state of mind nor arises out of a meditative state of mind; it abides neither in the world nor in Nirvana. One who gives like this gains no great fortune nor little fortune; gains neither profit nor loss; thereby correctly entering the Way of the Buddha, not relying on what has been heard [i.e. the path of the voice-hearer, the śrāvakas].’

‘Kāśyapa! Eating like this is not eating food that others give you in vain.’

“World-Honored One! When I heard him say these words, I gained what I had never had before, and I was inspired with a profound respect for all the bodhisattvas. And I thought to myself, 'This householder possesses such eloquence and wisdom and can speak like this! Who could listen to him without generating anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta?’ From then on, I ceased to urge others to follow the path of the voice-hearers or pratyekabuddhas (solitary awakened ones). For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

“If, Subhūti, you do not severe sensual desire, anger, and ignorance, and are also not associated with them; do not destroy the body, yet are in accord with the single characteristic; do not extinguish ignorance and longing, yet give rise to enlightenment and liberation; attain liberation by the characteristics of the five transgressions, yet are neither liberated nor bound; do not see the Four Noble Truths, yet do not not see the Truth; do not attain ‘fruits’, yet do not not attain ‘fruits’; are neither common nor free from common things [dharmas]; are neither sagely nor not sagely; are accomplished in all Dharma yet free from the characteristic of Dharma - then you can accept this food.”

“If, Subhūti, without seeing the Buddha, nor hearing the Dharma, taking those six teachers of heterodox ways: Purāṇa Kāśyapa, Maskari Gośālīputra, Sañjaya-Vairāṭīputra, Ajita Keśa Kambalin, Kakuda-Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha-putra; as your teachers, leaving home for them, and with those teachers defeat suffering - then you can accept this food.

If, Subhūti, you enter erroneous views and thus never reach the ‘other shore’; remain among the eight difficulties and never be without difficulty; identify with affliction and be free from all pure Dharmas; attain the samadhi of non-contention and all sentient being also attain this concentration; and those donors who support you do not name you the field of blessing; and those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths; and with a group of Maras you join hands and co-operate, and you and the Maras make all kinds of trouble for the world, becoming indistinguishable from Mara; bear resentment for all sentient beings, revile the Buddhas, denigrate the Dharma, refrain from entering the Sangha, forever never attaining the liberation of cessation. If you are like this - then you can accept this food.”

“World-Honored One! When I heard him say these words, I was dumbfounded. What could I think of saying? How could I reply? I put down the alms bowl, intending to leave the house, but Vimalakirti said to me, ‘Ah, Subhūti! Pick up your alms bowl and do not be afraid. Why? If the Thus Come one were to make an illusory person, and it were to reprimand you like this, would you be afraid?’
<<< “‘No,” I replied.”
>>> "Vimalakirti said, 'All things [dharmas] are like illusions [have the characteristic of being illusory]. You have no reason to be afraid. Why? Because all words and pronouncements too are no different than this [characteristic]. So the wise do not cling to words and hence are not afraid of them. Why? Words are apart from self­-nature — words do not really exist. And this is liberation. The characteristic of liberation is then all things [dharmas].”

>>> Aniruddha replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was somewhere walking about when a Brahma king named Purely Adorned [Śubhavyūha] along with ten thousand Brahma attendants, purely illuminated, all came to me, bowed their heads reverentially and asked, ‘How much, Aniruddha, can you see with the Divine Eye?’

“I answered them saying, ‘Gentlemen! I see this Three Thousand Great Thousand world system of Śākyamuni’s buddha land like I am observing a mango in the palm of my hand.’”

“At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, ‘Ah, Aniruddha! That which is seen by the Divine Eye, is it by way of characteristics or not by characteristics? If it is by characteristics, then it is the same as the five powers of the heterodox paths. If it is not by way of characteristics, then it is unconditioned and should not be ‘view’-able.’

“World-Honored One! At that time, I remained silent. Those Brahmas, hearing these words, gained what they had never had before! Then they made obeisance and asked, 'In this world, who possesses the true Divine Eye?'

"Vimalakirti replied, 'Only the Buddha, the World-Honored One, attains the true Divine Eye; constantly in samadhi, seeing all Buddha lands, not by dualistic characteristics [does not see in terms of duality].’

"Thereupon the Brahma king Purely Adorned and his retinue of five hundred Brahma gods all generated anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta. They bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and then suddenly vanished. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

Upāli
<<< 佛告優波離：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」
>>> The Buddha said to Upāli, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”
<<< 優波離白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念昔者，有二比丘犯律行，以為恥，不敢問佛，來問我言：『唯，優波離！我等犯律，誠以為恥，不敢問佛，願解疑悔，得免斯咎！』我即為其如法解說。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，優波離！無重增此二比丘罪！當直除滅，勿擾其心。所以者何？彼罪性不在內、不在外、不在中間，如佛所說，心垢故眾生垢，心淨故眾生淨。心亦不在內、不在外、不在中間，如其心然，罪垢亦然，諸法亦然，不出於如。如優波離，以心相得解脫時，寧有垢不？』我言：『不也！』維摩詰言：『一切眾生心相無垢，亦復如是。唯，優波離！妄想是垢，無妄想是淨；顛倒是垢，無顛倒是淨；取我是垢，不取我是淨。優波離！一切法生滅不住，如幻如電，諸法不相待，乃至一念不住；諸法皆妄見，如夢、如炎、如水中月、如鏡中像，以妄想生。其知此者，是名奉律；其知此者，是名善解。』於是二比丘言：『上智哉！是優波離所不能及，持律之上而不能說。』我即答言：『自捨如來，未有聲聞及菩薩，能制其樂說之辯，其智慧明達，為若此也！』時二比丘疑悔即除，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，作是願言：『令一切眾生皆得是辯。』故我不任詣彼問疾。」
>>> Upāli replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, two bhikṣus had violated the rules of conduct and were feeling ashamed of themselves but did not dare ask the Buddha what to do. So they came to me and said, 'Ah, Upāli! We have violated the precepts and are truly ashamed, but we do not dare ask the Buddha what to do. Please free us from our doubts and remorse and tell us how we can be excused from blame.’”

"I was explaining to them how one goes about gaining liberation according to the Dharma when Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Upāli! Do not make the offense these two bhikṣus heavier than it is! You should go about wip­ing out their doubts and remorse at once and not disturb their minds further. Why? The nature of the offense is not inside, nor is it outside, nor is it somewhere in between.  As the Buddha has explained: Because the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled. Because the mind is pure, sentient beings are pure. The mind is also neither inside, nor outside, nor somewhere in between. Just as your mind appears, transgression and defilement also appear; all things [dharmas] also appear, not coming from thusness. [i.e. they are thus, they don’t come from something or somewhere or something.] Like when Upāli attains liberation by means of the characteristics of mind, does defilement remain?’”
<<< “’No,’ I said.”
>>> “Vimalakirti replied, ‘The characterstics of all sentient beings are without defilement [’stainless,’ ‘flawless,’ vimala] and are also like this. Ah, Upāli! Delusional thoughts are defilement. Thoughts that are not delusional are purity. Grasping at self is defilement. Not grasping at self is purity.

“Upāli! The arising and ceasing of every thing [dharma] does not abide (remain) - like illusions, like lightning. All things are not relative - not abiding even for a thought [moment]. All things are totally delusional - like dreams, like mirages, like the moon in water, like reflections in a mirror - and they arise from delusional thinking. One who knows this is called [an] Upholder of the Rules of Conduct. One who knows this is called Well Liberated.’”
<<< “‘The two bhikṣus said, ‘Such superior wisdom! Upāli cannot match this. There could be no better explanation of upholding the precepts.’”
>>> “I then replied saying, ‘Except for the Thus Come One, no voice-hearer or even bodhisattva has ever commanded such eloquence in their joyful explanation. How clear and penetrating his wisdom is!

“At that time the doubts and remorse of the two bhikṣus were wiped away and they generated anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta, also making the wish, ‘May all sentient beings gain eloquence like this.’ For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

Rāhula
<<< 佛告羅睺羅：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」
>>> The Buddha said to Rāhula, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”
<<< 羅睺羅白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念昔時，毘耶離諸長者子來詣我所，稽首作禮，問我言：『唯，羅睺羅！汝佛之子，捨轉輪王位，出家為道。其出家者，有何等利？』我即如法為說出家功德之利。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，羅睺羅！不應說出家功德之利。所以者何？無利無功德，是為出家；有為法者，可說有利有功德。夫出家者，為無為法，無為法中，無利無功德。羅睺羅！出家者，無彼無此，亦無中間；離六十二見，處於涅槃；智者所受，聖所行處；降伏眾魔，度五道，淨五眼，得五力，立五根；不惱於彼，離眾雜惡；摧諸外道，超越假名；出淤泥，無繫著；無我所，無所受；無擾亂，內懷喜；護彼意，隨禪定，離眾過。若能如是，是真出家。』於是維摩詰語諸長者子：『汝等於正法中，宜共出家。所以者何？佛世難值！』諸長者子言：『居士！我聞佛言，父母不聽，不得出家。』維摩詰言：『然！汝等便發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，是即出家，是即具足。』爾時三十二長者子皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，故我不任詣彼問疾。」
>>> Rāhula replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, all the sons of the elders of Vaiśālī came to me, bowed their heads in reverence and asked, “Ah, Rāhula! You are the Buddha's son, but you relinquished your position as wheel-turning king [cakravartī] and left the household life to follow the Way. What are the benefits of this?’ [i.e. ‘what are the fruits of the homeless life?’ sāmaññaphala].”

“I then explained the benefit of the merit of leaving the household life according to the Dharma [teachings of the Buddha]. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, ‘Ah, Rāhula! You should not explain the benefits of the merit of leaving the household life. Why? Being without benefit, without merit - this is leaving the household life. The benefit and merit of conditioned things (saṃskṛta dharma) may be explained. The leaving of household life is something unconditioned (asaṃskṛta dharma), and within the unconditioned there is no benefit or merit.’”
<<< “’Rāhula! Leaving household life is without ‘that’ and ‘this’, and also without any in between. Free from the sixty-two [erroneous] views, it abides in Nirvana. This is what the wise ‘accept’ [alluding to precepts], this is the place of practice of the sages - taming [controlling, disciplining, subjugating] the Maras, transcending the Five Ways, purifying the Five Eyes, attaining the Five Powers, and establishing the Five Faculties. Not being distressed by ‘that’, free from the mass of evils; toppling all heterodox ways, and surpassing all conventional names. Leaving the muck and mire, without any attachments; without self and without possession; without disturbance, carrying joy within; thoughts guarded, in accord with dhyana meditation - free from all transgression. If one can be like this - this is truly leaving home.’”
>>> “Vimalakirti then said to all the sons of the elders, “You would do well to leave home together in the correct Dharma. Why? It is rare to encounter a Buddha in the world!

“The sons of the elders said, ‘Sir! We have heard the Buddha say that one must not leave the household life without the permission of one's parents.'”

Vimalakirti said, “So it is! So you should immediately generate anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta, and this is leaving home, this is sufficient.’”

At that moment, thirty-two sons of elders generated anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta and, for this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

>>> Ānanda replied to the Buddha saying, ““World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, the World-Honored One had a little illness and could use some cow's milk. I took my begging bowl, went to the home of one of the great Brahmans, and stood by the gate. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Ānanda! What are you doing standing here so early in the morning with your begging bowl?'”

“I replied, ‘Sir! The World-Honored One has a little illness and could use some cow's milk, that is why I came here.’”

“Vimalakirti said, ‘Stop, stop! Ānanda! Do not say this. The body of the Thus Come One has the essence of vajra, cutting off all evil; a host of universal virtue gathered, how could there be illness?” How could there be affliction?’”
<<< “’Go in silence, Ānanda! Don’t slander the Thus Come One or let others hear this coarse speech. Don't let these heavenly beings of great majesty and virtue and these bodhisattvas who have come from pure lands of other regions hear such things said.’”

 “’Ānanda! Even a wheel-turning sage king, with his few bless­ings, is still able to avoid illness. How much more so, then, the Thus Come One, in whom immeasurable blessings meet, the surpasser of all!’”

‘”Be silent, Ānanda! Don’t make us experience this shame. If brahmans of the heterodox ways hear this, they will think, ‘Why is he called a teacher? He, himself, is ill and is unable to heal, how could he heal all illness?’ Venerable, could you secretly leave at once, and do not ley anyone hear.’”

“’You should know, Ānanda! The body of all Thus Come Ones is the Dharma Body, not a sensible body of desire. The Buddha as the World Honored One transcends the Triple Realm. The body of the Buddha is without ‘outflows’ [āsrava], all ouflows being already having been extinguished. The body of the Buddha is unconditioned, not fitting into any category. A body like this, how could there be illness? How could there be affliction?’”
>>> “At that time, World-Honored One! I was truly ashamed and regretful that I may have mistakenly heard what the Buddha said, even though I was so close! Then I heard a voice from nowhere [emptiness, or ‘the sky’] say, ‘Ānanda! It is as the scholar [sir] has said. But the Buddha has appeared in this evil world of five impurities and at present is cultivating the Dharma so as to save and liberate sentient beings. Be silent, Ānanda! Get the milk and do not feel ashamed!'”

"World-Honored One! Vimalakirti commands such wisdom and eloquence as this, for this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

Not Sensation, Perception, Conditioning, or Consciousness, nor the semblance of Consciousness or the nature of Consciousness. [I do] not observe an arising from the Four Great [Elements], being identical to Space. The six entrances are without accumulation, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind having been surpassed; Not being in the Triple Realm, the Three Defilements being transcended. In accord with the Three Liberations, the Three Illuminations are fulfilled, being equal to ignorance. Not a single characteristic, nor different characteristics, nor the characteristic of self, nor the characteristic of other, and neither without characteristics nor the characteristic of clinging [or, ‘clinging to characteristics’]. Not [on] this shore nor that shore, nor mid-stream, yet transforming sentient beings. [The Buddha is] observed to be within quiescent cessation, yet not forever ceased. Not this and not that; and not by this or by that. *Not known by knowledge, not conscious of by consciousness. Without darkness and without brightness; Without name and without qualities (nimitta); Without strength and without weakness; neither pure nor dirty. Not located anywhere, [yet] not without location; Neither conditioned nor unconditioned. Indescribable and inexplicable. Not generous and not stingy; Not disciplined and not transgressive; Not patience and not angry; Not determined and not lazy; Not focused and not distracted; Not wise and not foolish; Not honest and not deceitful; Not coming and not going; Not exiting and not entering, all manners of speaking being cut off. Neither a field of blessings nor not a field of blessings. Neither worthy of offerings nor not worthy of offerings; Neither grasping nor letting go. Neither having characteristics nor being characteristicless. Identical to the Limit of Reality, equal to the nature of *dharma. Unweighable, incalculable going beyond all weight and measure. Neither large nor small; Neither seen nor heard; Neither understood nor known, free of all ties and bonds. Equal to All-Knowledge and identical to sentient beings, not different from all dharmas. Everything, without loss, without impurity, without affliction, without action, without coming about, without arising, without ceasing. Without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without weariness, and without attachment. Without having been, without a will be, and without a now is. All words and explanations whatsoever cannot differentiate or demonstrate. World-Honored One! The Body of the Thus Come One being so, it is observed like this. To observe that way is called Correct Observing; To observe some other way, is called incorrect observing.”

Those sentient beings who, either now presently or after the Buddha’s cessation, hear this sutra, they will also attain good benefit. How much more so if, after hearing it, they are liberated by faith, accepting, reciting, explaining, and practicing according to it! Those whose hands get to hold this sutra will attain the entire storehouse of Dharma Jewels. If one reads, recites, explains its meaning, and practices according to what it means, one will be protected and remembered by the buddhas. To make offerings to such a person, you should know, is to make offerings to a Buddha. To copy and maintain copies of sutras, you should know, is to be in the company of the Thus Come One. To hear this sutra and become joyful accordingly will achieve omniscience. To have faith in this sutra, even just four lines, and explain it to others, you should know, this person receives the prediction of anuttarā samyak-saṃbodhi.”

>>> 爾時毘耶離大城中有長者，名維摩詰，已曾供養無量諸佛，深植善本，得無生忍；辯才無礙，遊戲神通，逮諸總持；獲無所畏，降魔勞怨；入深法門，善於智度，通達方便，大願成就；明了眾生心之所趣，又能分別諸根利鈍，久於佛道，心已純淑，決定大乘；諸有所作，能善思量；住佛威儀，心大如海，諸佛咨嗟！弟子、釋、梵、世主所敬。
<<< At that time, in the great city of Vaiśālī there was an elder named Vimalakīrti. He had already offered alms to immeasurable Buddhas in the past, had deeply planted roots of goodness, and had grasped the patient tolerance of birthlessness. Unhindered in eloquence, he roamed in the transcendental powers, and commanded full retention of the teachings. He had attained the state of fearlessness, over­coming the torments and ill will of Mara. He had entered the profound Dharma Doors and excelled in transcendent Wisdom (Prajñāpāramitā), a master of upāya, expedient means, he had successfully fulfilled the great vow. He could clearly discern the tendencies of the minds of sentient beings, and was also capable of distinguishing their capacities (faculties, indriya), keen or obtuse. His mind having long been clear and purified through the Way of the Buddha and he was firmly on the Great Vehicle. Everything he did was well thought out and planned. He abided with the dignity and authority of a Buddha, his mind as vast as an ocean, and all the Buddhas sighed in admiration! Disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, World Leaders, all praised him.
>>> 欲度人故，以善方便，居毘耶離；資財無量，攝諸貧民；奉戒清淨，攝諸毀禁；以忍調行，攝諸恚怒；以大精進，攝諸懈怠；一心禪寂，攝諸亂意；以決定慧，攝諸無智；雖為白衣，奉持沙門清淨律行；雖處居家，不著三界；示有妻子，常修梵行；現有眷屬，常樂遠離；雖服寶飾，而以相好嚴身；雖復飲食，而以禪悅為味；若至博弈戲處，輒以度人；受諸異道，不毀正信；雖明世典，常樂佛法；一切見敬，為供養中最；執持正法，攝諸長幼；一切治生諧偶，雖獲俗利，不以喜悅；遊諸四衢，饒益眾生；入治政法，救護一切；入講論處，導以大乘；入諸學堂，誘開童蒙；入諸婬舍，示欲之過；入諸酒肆，能立其志；若在長者，長者中尊，為說勝法；若在居士，居士中尊，斷其貪著；若在剎利，剎利中尊，教以忍辱；若在婆羅門，婆羅門中尊，除其我慢；若在大臣，大臣中尊，教以正法；若在王子，王子中尊，示以忠孝；若在內官，內官中尊，化政宮女；若在庶民，庶民中尊，令興福力；若在梵天，梵天中尊，誨以勝慧；若在帝釋，帝釋中尊，示現無常；若在護世，護世中尊，護諸眾生。長者維摩詰，以如是等無量方便饒益眾生。
<<< Desiring to rescue others, he lived in Vaiśālī as an expedient (upaya). With his immeasurable wealth he embraced the poor and helpless. His faultless observation of the precepts (sila) embraced all [those] violating prohibitions. Through the practice of patient tolerance, he embraced all rage and anger. With great determination (virya) he embraced all laziness. Single-minded in dhyanic meditation, he embraced all chaotic thought. With firm, certain Wisdom he embraced all ignorance.

Though dressed in [the] white robes [of a layman], he observed all the rules of pure conduct laid down for monks, and though he lived at home, he had no attachment to the Triple World. One could see he had a wife and children, yet he always practiced the Pure Way of Brahma **(celibacy). It was obvious he had kin and household attendants, yet he always delighted in withdrawing from them. Although he wore jewels and finery, he was really adorned with the auspicious marks. Although he ate and drank like others, the joy of dhyana meditation is what he truly savored.

If he visited gambling parlors, it was solely to rescue people. If he received some other teaching, it did not impinge upon his true faith. Though well versed in secular writings, he constantly delighted in Buddha Dharma. Respected by everyone, he was looked on as foremost among those deserving of alms. Upholding the correct Dharma, he embraced old and young alike. He conducted all kinds of business enterprises in the spirit of trust and harmony, with no delight in worldly profit. He frequented the busy crossroads in order to bring benefit to others. He entered government offices and courts of law so as to aid and rescue all those he could. He entered places of debate in order to guide others to the Great Vehicle. He entered all the study halls to further the instruction of the students. He entered all houses of licentiousness to point out the errors of desire. And he entered wine shops in order to encourage those capable of ‘standing up’.

If among elders, he was the elder most revered, for explaining the superior Dharma. If among lay believers, he was the lay believer most revered, for having cut off all their greed and attachments. If among kṣatriya warriors, he was the kṣatriya most revered, for teaching them patient tolerance (kshanti). If among Brahmans he was the Brahman most revered, for ridding them of the conceit of ‘self’. If among great ministers he was the great minister most revered, for teaching the Correct Dharma. If among princes he was the prince most revered, for demonstrating loyalty and obedience. If among the inner palace, he was the inner palace member most revered, for converting and bringing refinement to the women [of the harem/inner palace]. If among common people, he was the common person most revered, for helping them gain wealth and power. If in Brahma’s heavens he was the most revered in Brahma’s heaven, for revealing superior Wisdom. If in Śakra’s [heaven] he was the most revered in Śakra’s [heaven], for demonstrating (pointing out, explaining) impermanence. If among the guardians of the world he was the most revered among the guardians of the world, for guarding all sentient beings.

The elder Vimalakirti, thus employed immeasurable numbers of upāya in order to bring benefit to others.
>>> 其以方便，現身有疾。以其疾故，國王大臣、長者居士、婆羅門等，及諸王子并餘官屬，無數千人，皆往問疾。其往者，維摩詰因以身疾，廣為說法：「諸仁者！是身無常、無強、無力、無堅、速朽之法，不可信也！為苦、為惱，眾病所集。諸仁者！如此身，明智者所不怙；是身如聚沫，不可撮摩；是身如泡，不得久立；是身如炎，從渴愛生；是身如芭蕉，中無有堅；是身如幻，從顛倒起；是身如夢，為虛妄見；是身如影，從業緣現；是身如響，屬諸因緣；是身如浮雲，須臾變滅；是身如電，念念不住；是身無主，為如地；是身無我，為如火；是身無壽，為如風；是身無人，為如水；是身不實，四大為家；是身為空，離我我所；是身無知，如草木瓦礫；是身無作，風力所轉；是身不淨，穢惡充滿；是身為虛偽，雖假以澡浴衣食，必歸磨滅；是身為災，百一病惱；是身如丘井，為老所逼；是身無定，為要當死；是身如毒蛇、如怨賊、如空聚，陰界諸入所共合成。
<<< Using these upāya, he made it appear that his body was ill. Because of his illness, the king of the country, the great ministers, elders, lay believers, and Brahmans, as well as the princes and lesser officials, numbering countless thousands, all went to see him and inquire about his illness.

Vimalakirti then used this bodily illness to explain the Dharma to those who came. "Friends! This body is imperma­nent, without durability, without strength, without firmness, a thing that decays in a moment, not to be relied upon! It leads to suffering, affliction, a meeting place of manifold ills.

Friends! A body like this, no enlightened person could rely upon. This body is like a cluster of foam, noth­ing you can grasp or handle. This body is like a bubble that can­ not continue for very long. This body is like a flame born of longing and desire. This body is like a plantain tree that has no firmness in its trunk. This body is like a phantom, the product of error and confusion. This body is like a dream, compounded of false and empty visions. This body is like a shadow, appearing only through karmic causes. This body is like an echo, tied to causes and condi­tions. This body is like a drifting cloud, changing and vanishing in an instant. This body is like lightning, barely lasting from moment to moment. This body is like the earth element, which has no subjective being. This body is like the fire element, devoid of self. This body is like the wind element, which has no set life span. This body is like the water element, devoid of individuality. This body has no reality but makes these four elements its lodging. This body is empty, removed from self and the possessions of self. This body is without understanding, like plants or trees, tiles or pebbles. This body is without agency, blown about by the wind. This body is impure, crammed with defile­ment and evil. This body is vacuous and unreal, though you may bathe and cleanse it for a time, clothe and feed it, in the end it must crumble and fade. This body is plague-ridden, beset by a hundred and one ills and anxieties. This body is like an abandoned well on the hillside, old age pressing in on it. This body has no fixity, but is destined for certain death. This body is like poiso­nous snakes, vengeful bandits, or an empty village, a mere com­ing together of aggregates, realms, and sense-fields.
>>> 「諸仁者！此可患厭，當樂佛身。所以者何？佛身者即法身也；從無量功德智慧生，從戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見生，從慈、悲、喜、捨生，從布施、持戒、忍辱、柔和、勤行精進、禪定、解脫、三昧、多聞、智慧諸波羅蜜生，從方便生，從六通生，從三明生，從三十七道品生，從止觀生，從十力、四無所畏、十八不共法生，從斷一切不善法、集一切善法生，從真實生，從不放逸生；從如是無量清淨法生如來身。諸仁者！欲得佛身、斷一切眾生病者，當發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。」
<<< “Friends! A thing like this is irksome and hateful, and therefore you should desire the body of a Buddha. Why? Because the body of a Buddha is the Dharmakaya, the Dharma Body. It is born from immeasurable merits and wisdom. It is born from precepts, meditation, wis­dom, liberation, and the insights of liberation. It is born of kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. It is born of the various pāramitās: generosity, discipline, patience, determination, meditation, liberation, samadhi, all the teachings, and Wisdom. It is born from upāya. It is born from the six supernatural powers. It is born from the thirty-seven aids to Awakening. Born from right observation. Born from the ten powers. Born from the four fearlessnesses. Born from the eighteen unique dharmas [of a Buddha]. Born from cutting off all unvirtuous dharmas. Born from gathering all virtuous dharmas. Born from the Truth of Suchness. Born from the avoidance of indulgence and laxity. Born from immeasurable, pure Dharma like this, is the body of the Thus Come One.

Friends! If you want to attain the body of a buddha and cut off all the illnesses of sentient beings, you should generate anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta (the highest, most correctly awakened mind, ‘bodhicitta’).”  
>>> 是長者維摩詰，為諸問疾者，如應說法，令無數千人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。
<<< So, the elder Vimalakirti used the occasion of those coming to inquire about his illness to explain the Dharma, causing numberless thousands of people to all generate anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.
